extracts from the speeehofmr horace mann in the home of representatives feb il on slavery and the slave trade in the ihstnct of columbia mr chairman there is a bill upon the speakers table which provides for abolishing the slave trade in the district of columbia for three successive days we have tried in vain to reach it jin the order of business its opponents have baffled our efforts our difficulty is not in carrying the bill but in reaching it i am not without apprehension that the last sands of this congress will run out without any action upon the subject even should the bill j be taken up it is probable that all debate upon itwill be suppressed by that sovereign silencer the previous question hence avail myself of the present opportunity as it is probably the only one i shall have during the present session to submit my views upon it i frankly avow in the outset that the bill provides for one part only of an evil whose remedy as it seems to me is not only the object of a reasonable desire but of a rightful and legal demand the bill proposes the abolition not of slavery but only of the slave trade in the district of columbia my argument will go to show that within the limits of this district slavery ought not to exist in fact and does not exist in law sir in the first place let us inquire what is the state of things in this district on this subject the gentleman from indiana mr r w thompson who addressed us a few days since jsed the following language what is the slavetrade in the district of columbia i have heard a reat deal said about slave pens about slaves sold at auctionand about stripping the mother from the child and the husband from the wife these things may exist here but i do not know of them since i have been in the habit of visiting the districtwhich is from my boyhoodl have never seen a negro sold herel have never seen a band of negroes taken off by the slave trader do not remember that have ever seen the slave trader him helf know nothing of the slave pen that is so much talked about it maybe here however and these things may happen every day before the eyes of gentlemen who choose to hunt them up but for myself i have no taste for such things now sir if the gentleman means to say that he has no personal knowledge of slave pens and of the slave traffic in this district that is one thing but it lie means to deny or call in question the existence of the traffic itsali or of the dens where its concentrated iniquities make uplhe daily employment of men that is quile another thing sir from the western front of this capitol from the piazza that opens out from your congressional library as you cast your eye along the horizon and over the conspicuous objects of the landscape the presidents mansion the smithsonian institution and the site of the v ashinglon monumentyou cannot fail to see the horrid and black rece taclea where human being are penned like cattle and kept like cattle that they may be sold like cattleas strictly and literally so as oxen and swine are keot and sold at the smithfield shambles in london or at the cattle fair in brighton in a communication made during the last session by the mayor of this city to an honorable member of this house he acknowledges the existence of slave pens here up and down the beautiful river that sweeps along the the north star j western margin of the district slavers j j come and go bearing their freight of human souls to be vended in this marketplace and after the have changed hands according to the forms of commerce the are retransportedthe father of a family to go perhaps to the rice fields of south carolina the mother to the cotton fields of alabama and the children to be scattered over the sugar plantations of louisiana or texas sir it is notorious that the slave traders of this district advertise for slaves in the newspapers of the neighboring counties of maryland to be delivered in any numbers at their slave pens in this city and that they have agents in the city and out of it who are engaged in supplying victims for their shambles since the gentleman from indiana was elected to this congress and believe since he took his seat in this congress one cofile of about sixty slaves came chained and driven into this city and at about the same time another cofflc of a hundred here they were lodged for a short period j were then sold and went on their rej turnless way to the engulfing south but the gentleman from indiana says but for myself have no taste fori such things his taste explains his vision suppose wilberforce and clarkson had had no taste for quelling the horrors of the african slave trade suppose howard and mrs fry to have had no taste for laying open the abominations of the prisonhouse iand for giving relief to the prisoner suppose miss dix to have had no taste for carrying solace and comfort and restoration to the insane suppose the abbe lepee to have had no taste for teaching deaf mutes or the abbe hauv for educating the blind or m scguin and others for training idiots and for educing docility and decency and a love of order from those almost imperceptible germs of reasons and sense that barely distinguish them from the brutes suppose these things and in what a different condition would the charities and the sufferings of the world have been herod had no taste for sparing the lives of the children of bethlehem and of all the coasts there j of and doubtless he could have said with entire truth that he never heard the voice in rama of lamentation and weeping and great mourning nor saw among all the mothers of syria any rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they were not rut sir just in proportion as the light of civilization and christianity dawns upon the world will men be found who have a taste for succoring the afflicted and for righting tue wronged it was the clearest proof of the great teachets mission that he had a taste for going about doing good during the last fifty yeas and especially during the last half of these fifty years the world has made great advances in the of liberty human rights have been recognized and their practical enjoyment to some extent secured there is not a govj ernment in europe even the most iron j and despoticai of them all that has not participated in the ameliorations w hich characterize the present age a noble catalogue of rights has been wrested by the british commons from the british nobility france and italy have been revolutionized even the pope of rome whose power seemed as eternal as the hills on which he was seated has sunk under the shock prussia and all the germanic powers with the exception of austria have been half revolutionized and even the icy despotisms of austria and russia are forced to relent under those central fires iof liberty which burn forever in the human heart as the central fires of the earth burn forever at its coregreat britain has abolished african slavery throughout all her realms france has declared that any one who shall voluntarily become the owner of a slave or shall voluntarily continue to be the owner of a slave cast upon him by bequest or inheritance shall cease to bea citizen of france denmark has abolished slavery wherever it existed in her possessions the bey of tunis acting under the light of the mohammedan religion has abolished it the priests of persia declare the sentiment to have coine by tradition from mohammed himself that the worst of men is the seller of men not only all civilized nations but the halfcivil ized the semibarbarous are acting under the guidance of the clearer light and the higher motives of our day but there is one conspicuous exception there is one government which closes its eyes to this increasing light which resists the persuasiou of these ennobling motives which on the grand subject of human liberty and human rights is stationary and even retrogrades while the whole world around is advancing sleeps while all others are awaking loves its darkness while all others are aspiring and ascending to a purer air and a brighter sky this government too is the one which is most boastful aud vainglorious of its freedom and if the humiliating truth must be spoken this goveromeat is our own in regard to slavery and the slave trade in this district where we possess the powor of exclusive legislation we stand where we stood fifty years ago not a single ameliorating law has been passed in practice we are where we were then in spirit there are proofs that we have gone backward there are now on the surface of the globe two conspicuous places places which are attracting the gaze of the whole civiliasd worldwhither men and women are brought from great distances to be sold and whence they are carried to great distances to sutler the heaviest wrongs that human nature can right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of its all and all we are brethren bear one of these places is the coast of africa which is among the most pagan and benighted regions of the earth the other is the district of columbia the capital and seat of government of the united states as far back as congress did what it could to abolish the slave trade on the coast of africa in it declared the foreign slave trade to be piracy but on the lst of january a bill was introduced into this house to abolish the domestic slave trade in this districthere in the centre and heart of the nationand seventytwo representatives voted against it voted to lay it on the table whereas we all know it would sleep a dreamless sleep this was in the house of representatives it is well knojvn that the senate is still more resistant of progress than the house and it is th opinion oi many that even if a bill should pass both house and senate it would receive the executive veto by authority of congress the city ofwashington is the congo of america but still more degrading than this there is another contrast which we present to the whole civilized w t orld the very slaves upon whom we have trodden have risen above us and their moral superiority makes our conduct ignominious not europeans only not only arabians and turksare emerging from the inhumanly and the enormities of the slave traffic but even our own slaves transplanted to the land of their fathers are raising barriers against the spread of this execrable commerce on the shores of africa a republic is springing up whose inhabitants were transplanted from this egypt of bondage and now look at the government which these slaves and descendants of slaves have established and contrast it with our own they discard the institution of slavery while we cherish it a far greater proportion of their children than of the white children of the slave states of this union are at school in the metropolis of their ration their flag does not protect the slave traffic nor wave over the slave mart would to god that the very opposite of this were not true of our own their laws punish the merchandise of human beings our laws sanction and encourage it they have erected and are erecting fortifications and military posts along the shores of the atlantic for seven hundred miles to prevent pirates from invading the domain of their neighbors and kidnapping people who to them are foreign nations we open marketplaces here at the centre ofthe nation where from seven hundred miles of coast the seller may come to sell and where buyers may come tef buy and whence slaves are carried almost as far from their birthplace as africa is from america the governor of liberia has lately made a voyage to england and france and entered into treaties of amity and commerce with them and he has obtained naval forces from them to abolish this traffic in human beings at the same time we are affording guaranties to the same traffic virginia and maryland are to the slave trade what the interior of africa once was the potomac and the chesapeake are the american niger and bight of benin while this district is the great government barracoon whence coftles are driven across the country to alabama or texas as slave ships once bore their dreadful cargoes of agony and woe across the atlantic the very race then which were first stolen brought to this country despoiled of all the rights which god had given them kept in bondage for generations at last after redeeming themselves or being restored to their natural liberty in some other way have crossed the ocean established a government for themselves and are now setting us an example which should cause our cheeks to blister with shame sir there is an idea often introduced here and elswhere and made to bear against any restriction of slarvery or any amelioration of the condition ot the slave which i wish to consider it was brought odiously and peominently forward the other day by the gentleman from pennsylvania mr charles brow n the idea is that the slaves are in a better condition in this country than they would have been at home it is affirmed that they are brought under some degree of civilizing and humanizing influences amongst us which they would not have felt in the land ol their fathers let us look first at the philosophy ol this notion and then at its morality all those who use this argument as a defence or mitigation of the evils ol slavery or as a final cause for its existence assume that if the present three million slaves who now darken out southern horizon and fill the air with their groans had not been here in theii present state of bondage they would have been in africa in a stale of paganism now the slightest reflection hows that this assumption has no hash in truth not one of them all would now have been in existence if theii ancestors had not been brought to thu country and according to the lawi ot population operative among barbarous nations there are now just as mam inhabitants pagans cannibals oi what you please in africa as then would have been if the spoiler hat never entered their homes and ruv ished and borne them into boudage among savage nations or uomadti tribes the population equals the mean of subsistence ake away two three or four per cent of the consumers and the vacuum is immediately supplied the population keeps up to tb level of the production among sucl people there is always a tendency t increase faster than the means of inriiq rochester n y friday may increase take aws a part of then and this tendency to increase takes effect by its own rigorit executes itself it like a bow that unbends or j a spring that uncoils as soon as aa j external pressure is removed dam up i a fountain and the weight of the ac i cumulating strata will eventually check the outflow from the spring so it is of a savage population of them the j malthusian theory is true aud bow infinitely absurd and ridit culous is the plea that the slaves are better off here than thet t could have been in jifrica go out into the streets of this city and take the first one you meet perhaps he is a mulatto but for being here he would have been l a mulatto in the middle of africa would he take them all mulat o mestizo zambo and all the vast variety of man so far as color m concerned and if they had not their existence j here they would have had it in africa this is the doctrine would they have had the same american names also would they have spoken the same language and worn cotton grown on the same fields the last is just ascertain ns the first it is all more silly than the repinings of the silty girls who grieved because their mother had not married a certain rich suitor whose addresses in early life she had rejected for then said they how rich ve j should have been no not one of these three millions of men women and childrenwould have been in existence in africa all the crime of their kidnapping all the horrors of the middle passage all their sufferings for two centuries or six generations and all the calamities that are yet to grow out of their condition all these crimes and agonies are gratuitous crimes and ago niesthere is no recompense or palliation for themthey have been j added unnecessarily and remorselessly to the amount of human guilt and suffering for which the white race must answer in the day of account the idea then of sending the slaves back to their country is an egregious fallacy if they were to he sent back whence they came it would not be to africa but to nonentity if the ancestors of the present three millions of slaves had never been brought if their descendants had never been propagated here for the supposed value of their services their places would have been supplied by white laborers by men of the caucasian raceby freemen instead of the three million slaves of all colors we should doubtless now have at least three million white freeborn citizens adding to the real prosperity of the country and to the power of the republic if the south had not had slaves to do their work for them they would have become ingenious and inventive like the north and would have enlisted the vast forces of nature in their service wind and fire and water and stearn and lightning the mighty energies of gravitation and the subtle forces of chemistry the country might not have had so gaudy and ostentatious a civilization as at present but it would have had one infinitely more pure and sound but admit the alleged statement absurd and lalse as it is admit that these three millions of slaves would have belonged to africa if they had not belonged to america that they would have been born of the same fathers and mothers there as here so that those of them who are american mulattoes would have been ethiopian mulattoes and admit further that their present condition is better than the alternative condition alleged and what then is your duty done r is it enough if you have made the condition of a man or ofa race a little better or any better if you have not made it as much better as you can r n hut standard of morals do gentlemen propose to themselves rif a fellowbeing is suffering under a hundred diseases and we can relieve him from them all what kind of benevolence is that which boasts of relieving him from one and permits him to suffer under the other ninetyand nine by the law of nature and of god the slave like every other manis entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he is entitled to nia earningsto the enjoyment of his social affections to the development of hisintellectual and moral faculties to that cultivation of his religious nature which shall fit him not merely to feel but reason of righteousness temperance and a judgment to come he is entitled to all these rights of which he has been cruelly despoiled and when he catches some feeble glimmering of some of them withhold the rest and defend ourselves and pride ourselves that he is better off than he would have been in some other country or some other condition suppose the samaritan had bound up a single wound or relieved a single pang the bleeding wayfarer who had fallen among thieves and then had gone to the next inn and boasted of benevolence he would only have shown the difference between agood samaritan and abigot samaritan the thieve themselves might have done as much but there is another inquiry which he champion of gm to answer before the world and before heaven if american alnrea are better off than unlive afncana who tobe thanked ior it haa their improved condition reunited from anv purposed plan any welldtgeated systemaed measure carefully thought out and reasoned out and tnlendad for their benefit not all in all the southern statute hooka and legislative record there is no trace of any such scheme laws judicial decisions the writiua of political economistsall treat tba slave aa a thing to tanka men ey with agricultural societies give rewards for the beet crops horsejockey societies improve the fleetness of the breed for tho sports of the turf even the dogs have professional trainers but not one thing is done to bring out the qualities of manhood that lie buried in a slave look through the southern statute book and see what draconian penalties are inflicted for teaching a slave to readsee how he is lashed for attending a meeting to hear the word of god on every highroad patrols lie in wait to scourge him back if he attempts to see father mother wife child or friend on a neighboring plantation by day and lyr night at all times and everywhere he is the victim of an energetic and comprehensive system of measures which blot out his senses paralyze his mind degrade and brutify bis nature and suppress the instinctive workings of truth generosity and manhood in his breast all the good that reaches him is in defiance of these privations and disabilities if any light penetrates to his soul it is because human art cannot weave acloud dense and dark enough to be wholly impervious to itthere are some blessings which the goodness of god can bestow in spite of human efforts to intercept them it is these only which reach the slave after having built up all barriers to forbid the access of improvemect after having sealed his senses by ignorance and more than half obliterted his faculties by neglect and perversion the oppressor turns round and because there are some scanty incidental benefits growing out of the very deplorableness of his condition he justifies himself before the world and claims the approval of heaven because the slave is better off here than he would be in africa sir such an argument as this is an of fence to heaven i consider it to be as much worse than atheism as christianity is better and when such an argument comes from a gentleman belonging to a free state when it comes from the gentleman from pennsylvania mr brown from a representative of the city of vvm penn when he without motive without inducement offers such a gratuity to the devil i cannot account for it except on the principle of the man wrho having alceen relish for the flesh of sivioe said he wished he werc a jew that he might have the pleasure of eating pork and committing a sin at the same time to be continued what is tiie difference the supreme authority of these united states has declared that the slavetrade is piracy but what is this traflick which involves a degree of criminality that makes him who engages in it the enemy of mankind it is that slavetrade that steals the sons and daughters of africa and consigns them to christian bondage in this free land doubtless this is piracy of the worst kind but there is a traffick in slaves tolerated in this enlightened christian land that snatches from tho home of their childhood those whom god and nature have joined together that irons them together for along and weary and painful drive to the rice and cotton plantations of the south that dooms them to severe and unrequited labor to disease and an early death it is understood that the average life of transported slaves does not exceed ten years the unhealthiness of a new and vicious climate soon destroys those whom the severity of the toil and the lash had spared and on the other hand the toil wears out those whom the climate does not kill the violent separation of families and the dreadful expectation that those thus sent away are thus consigned to an early grave the fears of those who go and of those who stay the mourning and the pain and sorrow inseparable from this slavetrade stamp this accursed traflick with the same lineaments of cruelty and wrong as have excited the execration of mankind in the african slavetrade why should separation in africa be more painful to natural affection than in virginia why is the dread of cruelty qiore keen the hopelessness of separation more oppressive and the uncertainty of the future more frightful in africa than in america whoever thinks that the horrors of the middle passage enhance the atrocity of the african slave trade knows but little of the slavetrade between virginia and georgia the weariness of that toilsome journey the exhaustion and the sickness the soreness of the feet and the galling ol the chains besides the inflictions of the lash go far to match the atrocious wrongs of the traflick that spans the ocean with its cruisers besides all these physical sufferings there are moral evils connected with this traflick not less worthy of execration children are torn from their parents aad parents from their children in utter violation ol the rights which the god of nature has given vo both parents and the children husbands are separated from wives and wives from husbands in violation ol the most sacred rights and dearest interests of both the marriage tie is sundered if marriage ties are possible under the system of slavery temptations are held out to adoltery and crime and an utter recklessness of the obligations of this sacred relation necessarily created which must react will terrible force upon tbe children we need nut pursue the moral bearing of a system that is full of wroog this feature of the system of slaver is oneof its most cruel aspects and in iniridstc wrongs and its analogy t another traflick show that the systen i j has exacted toleration for an infamoui slavetrade scarcely less atrocious thai that which the civilized world hu pro i nounced piracy why should it not also be suppressed and for the same good reasons it is to be remembered too as one of the worst features of this interstatc slavetrade that it encourages the abominations of a portion of this traffick which is most disgracefulthat of raising men to sell it stimulates the in i crease of the slave population for mercenary ends nothing more painfully evinces the moral and social debasement of this sum of all villanies than these unutterable enormities no not even the african slavetrade itself jv f evangelist of the chrunotvpe frederick douglass i saw by the morning papers yesterday that frederick douglass was to speak in the evening at a church in marlon street i found this situated in rather an obscure part of the city and occupied by a colored congregation as their place for the slated preaching of the gospel the house was i plainly fitted up dimly lighted and as i entered scantily filled with a motley but earnestlooking assemblage such as you generally see at antislavery gatherings the formality of appointing a chairman and secretary having been despatched and two grave colored gentlemen satisfactorily installed in these respective offices the business ot the evening was opened with a very businesslike prayeralmost as short as an ordinary grace before meatj and of course very much to the point by a white clergyman or possibly by t a laybrother whose name i did not j learn by this time the audience hadj greatly increased and when dotiglassi ascended the platlorin he found hiinseltl in front of a numerous assemblywhesej quiet earnest deportment indicated adeep interest in the subject or a curiosity to listen to the eloquence of the celebrated colored orator i thought douglass did not look so well as usual nor did he show liis accustomed spirit he appeared a good deal worn by hard work and as he had been speaking intown on different occasions for several days past l dare say he was somewhat jailed both in mind and body he has not however lost his old vehement fiery eloquencehis voice is inspired by true deep passionand the earnestness of his manner gives force to his declarations the commencement of his speech was modest and conciliatory delivered for the most part in an undertone and expressing the embarrassment he felt in addressing an aiidi i posed of two races after a rapid but i complete and conclusive argument on the absurdity of confounding personality with property he announced his main subject the great men of the united states as indicating the standard of public morality after reviewing the career of gen taylorexpatiating on the services by which he had won the presidencyand denouncing his position and character as in the highest degree favorable to slavery he proceeded to discuss the political merits of henry clay the topic was evidently a favorite one with the speaker and he handled it wit it a force and unction that showed he was completely at home in it and that his burning words flew out like hot coals of fire from an excited deeply indignant soul clays letter to the people of kentucky he characterized as a master piece of inconsistency it was said he very eloquent but very sophistical filled with the most pious sentiments and the most nefarious principlesexhibiting the most tender love of humanity and the most hitter hatred of the negro j this did not seem to be precisely to the taste of all the audience i noticed several leave their seats and make for the door about this time one young gentleman in particular with a most conspicuous cravat passed near me

for their decorum on the whole douglass acquitted himself w ith credit the fiery invectives in whr h he so freely indulges are a part of his system of propagandist and though they may cause a fastidious taste to revolt they so clearly spring from an intense perception of wronga burning recollection of personal injury that one can hardly condemn their employment however much he may regret their ne cessity i wonders or the white nile lt is perhaps hardly necessary to remind the reader that the river nile is formed of two confluent streams the blue and the white whose junction is in south nubia between deg and deg of north latitude the source of the blue nile was ascertained by bruce and by subsequent travellers to be in the mountains of abyssinia but the course of the other branch which is by far the longest had been followed until very lately only as far south as deg orll deg north latitude keen nowthe river has not been traced to its origin although mr weme and his

officers but immediately issued placards throughout the city announcing that john randolph of roanoke would address his countrymen upon the banking system that evening from the steps ot the merchantv bank hours before the tune the crowd had become immense and the bank directors thoroughly frightened at such a demonstration made a virtue of necessity and tendered him the desired amount of specie

having during the last thirty years held many hundred meetings in public on the subject oi the american colonization society anc whereas at all these meetings they have uniformly protested against the doctrines the designs and influences of that society as rvi doctrines diabolical designs and slave crush tng influences which views we do still retain therefore lo it resolved that the idea of the american ol mization society when first conceived was combinedlv opposed and denounced by tlu people of color throughout the free stales ii and in the present moment being identically the same it has and will continue thave as it always has had iie ahhorence anri contempt of our people resolved that the testimony ol our generation of the people of color is entirely mi tbrmly and absolutely against the scheme of african olonization and that this solemn tes timonypeculiar in the history of this people should he abundant evidence to all men thal we will not remove to africa except bv ihe vercise of force resolved that as natives ol the anl we iee an affinity an attachment thereto which neither injury oppression nor insult in the form ol american colonization society or any other similar wicked scheme can destroy aiul it is out solemn determination while life lasts to le neither seduced nor driven from cur homes it is not my purpose said mr d m offering this preamble and resolutions to occupy much time this evening the gentleman w ho lias consented to second the resolution will dc so with more ability than i possibly could in fact i see that there is not much necessity ol my attempting to impress upon an audience ot our people any degree of disgust for the rontemptiblc efforts or the american olon ization society lor if there ik anv one suh icct upon which wc as a ieoplc are united itis in our detestation of that society kit c huilks lunox rtmonul scarcely need intimate sir that i take great pleasure in giving my second to the series of resolutions which have been presented to the con sideraltoii of this large and intelligent assembly through my friend mr downing and in aying so much sir could have wished to ave been allowed to take my seat for there re others present to whom should have prefeted to listen but sir i feel that the present meeting called for the purpose of discussing the subject which has been iuttoduceu loruut coiistaeration is one in which we as a people are deeply interested this though a one moves me more than any other to take this platform it is not my put post to recapitulate here either the history or the ori um of the american tionization society or u suiisoquem acts these things are before the american people they are acquainted with them andtl there is one object morel ban auother to be gamed by ue holding ot ibis mctmg apprehend it is to deepen tht detestation already entertained toward that in lamous scheme but sir we tail in one essential particular hero this evening wc have not the person before us who are mainly t lie supporters of the american colonization society if the were present should have no difficulty whai ever in saying the few things have to ox proas but if they heat me at all it must be through my audience and of course it can only go to them at secondhand that the entire people of colour arc opposed to the colonization society i do not believe and apprehend that there are those preset tins evening who are not prepared to sub enbe to the resolutions which hive just been introduced to such i litres few thought lo suggest and whilst i shall do so vlutjl endeavour to make a distinction between the spirit which prompted the american colonization society into bring and the spirit which prompts many coloured person to go to the colony of letsena in the spirit of met nrise and al venture v ith his class i have no war so to epr w myself and i relieve in the largest exercise of individual npiotons m dividua unbtuons for elevation and wealth and i also recognize the fullest nght in cot onred nions as well as in on bite to g when iliev shall choose to lor the purpose ol ivttcnng their enditon either morally politically or religiouslr say sir am here noi to oppose bat to give mv coami haoce to inion of this kind but l feel tbit the spirit of the american cokmntmi society ttvi its origin to rbe preset mom nt has k u to break up that rverri ofour individuality hate it sir not so much that believe it ever can remove the people of colour trom these initcd states but because  bellive that so long as it shall exist its tendency is to make more rabid the spirit of eate and prejudice against the coloured people in ibis country and i think sir that it is honest in this exprson that it comes lin esilv by this spirit i have however felt that the olonization society originated in amcrtcan slavery and coming from such n fouiit do nit believe that any good can rimo out of it therefore i have ever warred againt it and mnst be penuitted to do o now whv sr there nre those at the present mo mem who ran blink the charge which ihe american ohm nation society have ivom lime to lime preferred against the people of colour and in tn face of these chrrge ran insist that their is nevertheless chantv and even tiustianity in the movement well if the charges iiave net lecn sanctioned andi subscribed to by liie parent society i could allow i ntf charitv to go out to that extent but as long as rn remember having heard the i speeches of th leaders of t he i olonization society i have either found ihoe charges di recti y or indirectly made or subscribed to by i the different member of that society vnd what have those charges beinhave they j conveyed the idea that the free jcople of colour should h ocognicd on an egial footing with otiu r citizens in any part of the country under anv circumstances fi no occasion have i seen it on the contrary the cndcav l our has been from beginning lu end to prtju dice the american mind more deeply than it was before tinotieli the efforts of american slavery itself now l need not iutunate mr chairman liie grossne of tltae charges fhc j untrutlifulnces of them nor ihir bitterness hatred eirnutv and jealous but sir how are they in i met f hold ibas ibe present j meeting is the place to pul again the seal of i condemnation upon il sncli charges by the i adoption of neb ievolution as have been offered now i i v lhit tin viniiiem coiomza lion sikieiy through its auxiliary in iny native i state mas lchusctts bad been blazing i forth these charges some of the most tnllu enual of our talesmen as well as clergymen i have subscribed to them by their eonnte nance by their support by their contributions tjy ilitir appeals and by then prayers in be i half of the parent society and hence if has j ever been my endeavour to meet the society as found at its birth in and can no i more welcome the advocate of colonization that stands forth in laik street church in boston than i can homy clay when he do livers an anniversary oration in the city of j washington i liold the two to be identical j m this irutior be their position what they may in my native state or els where why sir i remember well when the question was being discussed concerning the abolition of the remnant of that old slave law the intermarriage law in the city of boston that when we as a people fooud fault that we were not at liberty to exercise one of the lirst prerogatives conferred upon us by our tfod and creator we were told in publicas well as in private tint if we did not like the customs usages and laws of our native state we could go to our fatherl n rca under the auspices of the ami zatinu society asked them lo repeat the i charges asked the legislature of that t state when it was my privilege to bland bet lore them if vve had ever sacrificed out j rights by our vices or whether vve had uol acquired them by our virtues and tfiat legislature remained silent and has remained stlen from that time to this and sir i hope the day is not far distant when upon that question i being put in other parm ot out country the j only ansuct that shall he made shall be out j of silence silence in many instances is i ominous and in this it is ominous in view n the infernal machinations of ihc american oloiiizalion society from the very inomeui i ol its inception to ihe present time heneo i whether m the abstract or in the concrete ii lever to lie detested by us as a people it i sever to be opposed and if necessary to fie resisted even to the shedding of the blood that will fiiula place in our heat is app lause now w ir a word with regard o these charges i see before me this evening i large number of people of colour what says the society that vve are low vicious idle besotted ui a word that we are nuisances and consequently that we must be removed but in the very next breath they trii the pa trims of the society rind hose whom hey would cnnveri to their cause remove tliesi low vicious idle hi snttf d nuisances to africa j and in an instant they stand up clothed in alli the attributes calculated to make them iuis sioiiarics ami teachers in the wink of civilization and f hrimiauity have asked them tr put ihis ami tliat together and reconcile tliem if tiievean my audience sir gives the lie tn tlie charges and mv audience will give the lie to them to night by endorsing these resolution and hope that when the pro ecedings of this meeting shall go over to kng j land and shall meet the eye of mr agent i miller that they will have the desired effect upon him that they will teach him that it vve are low and besotted in this country it is american siaverv and thjl olonizatiou sol ciety ilnt have made its so applause that i if vve arc vicious mcrican slavery lias made u vicious that u we are idle american pre i jinhre has made us idle in short that auuri i can slavery and tli american t olotiizalu n society have be n the mstnimcnis ol making us just what vve arc incur vices applause i now sir i cal upon this audience to give their unanimous sanction to the most radical i sentiments contained in this resolution and why do i sav it sir a distinguished mail i long ago has said eternal vigilance was the price of lierty i wish to repeat that motto by saying that eternal vigilance is the price of our safety as a people in the united stais aoplause hou docs it happen that in the slate of new york there aie thousands ofcolonred persons disfranchised how dot it happen that the same is true of the state of pennsylvania of connecticut and other slate can we trace it lo any other sonret than the one to which have referred i ap irehed not sir believe that henry clay with ai ins eloquence on one hand and john calhoun with all his dmlism laughter on the other would not come belore llu meeting and attempt to sustain their charges and why because my mend h c wngbt said of another inmou nt not long since m pfiiktd ifiia their movement carries upon its lac a lie and what is the lie why that a inca is our fatherland now apprehend that if we should note and count this audience vve snould be obliged lo come to the conclusion that the fatherland of the coloured people was a i oust anywhere else than africa great laughter think sir that there origin ujd be traceable to very nearly the aiune source where re found your clays your calhouns your mcduffies and yoor u isea iciiewcl iaiightei apprehend ibat n would ik lound in any other direetioo i tan africa at least but mv remark is nor hrcvnlv applicable to my audience alone a dimmguished mu said long ago that in the veins ol many a slave is known to course he bbwvl of t fie noblest of our southern planters well sir why does u happen that in the so t hers nuotry we find a lav unlike the j bw of any other eountrv beneath the canopy of beaten wo find the law there to be that the child dial follow the condition of the hither why i tb sii if the people in the boutberneimhhrtweie lo follow the coodi iin of the father we know very well what tint condition would he laughter and ap phase ow it aoenxi to me that the patrmta of the colonisation society need to change ihrtr phraseology and if they watat that we to to africa at all it should he oo the acore that africa is our tnotkrr and not our fatherland laughter i do not mr wib to convey the idea that if africa was nay fatherland i should be ashamed of it cert far from it for in view of the rices of the white american oo the one hand and the vtrtueaof the coloured american on the other i think nr may lc deeidedlv more pmud of uur ancestry than they can he of theirs so far as the lasi one or two hundred years is concerned we hare everything else to be ashamed of on our part and f am not liere to deprecate the colonization society on the score of being a miamed of africa as my fatheriand tell me not of my fatherland or m mother land that is my fatherland where i happen to j be born and claim an equal right to remain here with the white inhabitants why sir i rnv grandfather was among the first that repaired to the plains of ami there bared hi bosomnot sir in defence ot the i coloured population exclusively but he bared i his bosom to the british bullets for the liberty and independence of the american people and the freedom of american soil great applause and sir i shuld indeed be ashamed cf my ancestry if did not now assert and give not only the american people but the world to understand that here was born and here am to defend mv right to live and to die j applauae j ret chartes b kaymr chairman whan lkk around and sec those present whom we all vant to hear had much rather be silent than io be heard but have had ai resolution placed in my hands by the com mitten with a request that would oiler and sustain it by a lew remarks will remark mr chairman before l read the resolution i that there is one question which when it is j to cotuc before any meeting when it is to be grappled with whether in this city or almost i anywhere else in this country out whole peo pie never tail to be present to consider it everybody wants lo itavc something to do with branding olonization and you have only i to give notice that a meeting is to be held for that object and the house is full fuller than it can b made by the discussion of any j oilier question but to the resolution resolved that in the principle atthe basis of the american olonization scheme we recognize the fostering spirit ot american caste the spirit which would degrade us in the church which would eject ns from the literary institutions of the country and heap insult upon us in our every endeavour for elevation the resolution which i have read declares j that the principle c of the american olo nization society fosters american caste sir would say more ilian this it creates american caste and then like all other affectionate parents it nurses dearly and takes the best possible care of its child that it die not but live to do its work and however terrible that work may be to the destiny of the colored people of this country colonization cares not sir what is this caste why it is an attempt to divide men invidiously into classes and to create nonintercourse between lhoe classes making it reproachful for those claiming to be superior to associate with or visit the inferior forbidding ail intercourse under the penalty of losing ones standing american caste pro cribes the colored people and makes their complexion a badge of disrespect and contempt which forever bars them from inter i course with their brethren of a white skin it singles them out as a class not to be visited cared for or linked by any lies to those who claim to lie ol superior standing to our sad experience mr chairman we know that these things are true and the istory of the movements and operations ol the colonization suci ty proves that the scheme tends lo degrade us in ejecting ua from the literary institutions of the country ye opposition and insult meet us at every step hi our endeavour for improvement in learning and when we attempt lo secure an education for ourselves we have to tncei colonization and battle with it if vc attempt toi seek equal political privileges there too we have to meet the spirit of colonization lwo claim civil rights the spirit and influence of colonization is amongst us which says f you must not live here you cannot live hereon equal terms with the whites this is nol vour home and you must go to your own country in every way in which we attempt t to rise we meet this spirit and to coloni i zation arid its operations probably more than to any other single cause is lo be attributed i this unjust prejudice colonization has strode t through this country falsitving the colored men misrepresenting us and speaking lies ol us lv saying that we were the most degraded i of alt classes that could possibly exist in civilized life colonization has made ihe peo pie behove all this and ha produced in the public mind that conviction more than anything else it has infused into it wrong no tionseand false views of colored men andr has thereby waked up wrong feelings wfcucli have led to ill treatment of us those feelings are sometimes very honestly entertained wei i have no doubt bm much ot it is dishonest and hypocritical in ail such views which have so governed men in their course and v worked death to us there is more of the fruil i of the colonization scheme than of any existing institution in this land more than ever i slavery itself applause the speaker who preceded me spoke of his grandfather having taken a part in the greai battle lor trceduiii in tins country i can aay i the same of some ot my ancestry whe shouldered their muskets and went out against i the foe of this land why then miy uoi the sons of these patriots claim in common with others lite liberty and the pursuit ol i happiness ui the land that gave them birth  tims g our home and may reiterate the sentiment already uttered here we mean to live and here to die applause mr h vsies l reason rose to present the following resolution i resolved that from evidence in the past history of the liberian colony we have reason to believe that it has been recreant to ii the cause of human freedom and an euslavei  of its own kmdred mr reason in support of this resolution confined himself principally to the reading of extracts fioin the day book edited by dr i bacon the facts presented were recently published in the north star and need not hetc be repeated mr tcloeriek doe class mr chairman there is io end to

ol schemes as egypt war i frogs in these circumstances we ought j to be alway s on the look out armed at an points and ready to march in any direction and to meet the enemy whether ui this oi any

reality uf a demon profcanag sjmj at by fur the colored couple of americait uhours t drive ua from our home and country mr chairman the tumlaroental and as danid webster would saythe everlasting objection to coloaizutioti is tbu that it assume that the colored people while they remain in this country can never stand on so soal footing with the white population of the jited states this objection say is a fundamental one it lies at the very basis of this enterptise and as such i am opposed toit have ever been opposed to it and shall presume ever continue to oppose it it takes the ground that the colored people of this country can never he fiee can never improve here and it is spreading throughout the country this hopedestroying this misanthropic doctrine chilling the aspirations of the colored people themselves and leading them to feel that they cannot indeed ever be free in this land jn this lespect the influence of the colonization scheme has been most disastrous to us it has advocated the most stringent persecution in some instances towards colored men but let me sir tend a resolution resolved that if it be left optional with a slave to goto africa or not we advise him not to go but rather to remain hero and add to the number of those who may yet imitate the example of our fathers of tll t do not mean to sav here mv friends that this result is a desirable one the result to which lookhut look to it as an inevitable one if the ration shall persevere in the enslavement of the colored people have not the slightest doubt but that at this moment in tlie southern statcsthero arc skilfullycou i trived and deeplylaid schemes in the midst it least of the leading thinkers there for the accomplishment of this very result the slaveholders are sleeping on slumbering vol jearoe if they did but know it and want i every colored man in the south to remain tlieie and cry in the ears of the oppressors liberty for all or chains for all great applause want them to stay there with the understanding that the day may comel do not say it will come i do not say that would hasten j it do not say that i would advocate the result or aim to accomplish or bring it about but i say it may come and in so saying only base myself upon the doctrine of the scriptures and upon human nature and speaking out through all history those i that lead into captivity shall go into captivity those that take the sword shall terish by the swotd those who have trampled upon i us for the last two hundred years who have used their utmost endeavours to crush every noble sentiment in our bosom and destroy our manly aspiration those who have given ua blood to drink for wages may expect that their turn will come one day it was in view of this fact that thomas jefferson looking down through the vista of the future exclaimed i tremble for my country when  rellect that god is just and that his justice canu t sleep forever he saw even through the distance of lime through winch he looked down beyond the present to a future period i when the spirit of liberty and manhood would lead the slave to bare his bosom and struggle in his chains for freedom as was illustrated by the fathers of o applause and seeing this he said i tremble lor my country the colonization scheme aims they savi to prevent or avert this disastrous consequence sir such an effort is unscnptutal it is unchristian there is no other way whereby men can escape the penalty of their crimes but by repentance but instead of preaching repentance to slaveholders these colonization isis are proposing to remove away from them the object uf their hatred without dislocating the hatred itself i say then that itis unchristian and unscnpturol those slaveholders must take the consequence of theit crime man loves liberty and will ever try to regain it the cry of the slave goes up to heaven to god and unless the american people shall break every yoke and let the oppressed go free that spirit in man which abhors chains and will not he restrained by them will lead j those sable arms that have iong been engaged in cultivating beautifying and adorning the south to spread death and devastation there great app ausc some men go for the abolition ol slavery by peaceable means so do i am a peace man hut i recognize in the southern states at this moment as lias been remarked here a state of war sir know that am speaking now not to this audience alone for i see reporlers here andi learn that what is spoken here is to bo published and will be read by oolonizationists and perhaps by slaveholders i want them to know that at least one colored man in the i union peace man though lie is would greet with joy the glad news should it come here tomorrowthat an insiurection had broken out in the southern slates great applause j i want them to know that a black man cherish j es that sentiment that one of the fugitive i slaves holds it and that it is not impossible i that some other black men a voicewe are i all so here may have occasion at some time or oilier to put this theory into practice siri want to alarm the slaveholders and not to alarm them by mere declamation r hv roero bold assertions hut to show them that theiv areally danger in persisting in the crime ol continuing slavery in this land i want them to know that there are some madison wash ingtons in this country applause the american people have lieon accustomed to regard us as interior beings the colonization society lias told them that we are inferior beings and that in consequence of our calm and tame submission to the yoke which they have imposed upon us to theirchains fctteis gags lashes whippingposts dungeons and bloodhounds we must be regarded a inferior i that there is no light in us and that u j evidence enough it prove that god intended us to retain the position w hich we now oc copy want to prevent them from laving this flattering enaction to their souls there are coloied persons who hold other views who j entertain other feelings with ropect to thin matter as an illustration ot the spirit that is in the black man let me refer totbe story of madison washington the treatment of that man by this government was such as to dsgrace it in the eyes of thecivslzed world he escaped some years ago from virginia and succeeded in reaching canada where nestled in the name of die br ush

escape under the guidance of her liberal party from the trammels of mouirchr and aristocracy and she will speedily show ean example of what is the tine meaning ot the word liberty there is still another reason why canada should not be annexed to lto untied states would she be admitted aa a fine or as a sh state free of course there are no slaves there now and never can be slaves there she

weight passed through this eity on wedaeaday last on his way west he expects to spend the summer in ohio in presenting myself before von this evening shill briefly invite your attention back six thousand years when the structure known as the globe which wo now occupy was without shape oi comelinesswhen the now expansive ocean was not created or the firmament which now stretches itself over our heads had come from the hands of the living god he spake and behold a promiscuous dark fluid an unformed chaos or gloomy mass of substance such as had never before existed and the voice of god from the midst thereof said let there be light and at his command the misty darkness was dispelled and light shone around his own almighty mind then eontemplaud the vastness of his purksc he viewed with pleasure and delight the glory diua shed around him and again spake and the light wa separated from the darkness god then proceeded in his divine wisdom to plan the great universe complete in all its parts a we now behold itthe sun the moon the stare and all the various works which beautify and adorn the natural world there are various conjectures as to the time f creation the most learned and eminent men have differed in this matter while capelins and others would have the creation commenced in the spring about the nth of april the great usher would have it in the fall according to isher calculations he would have us date the commencement on the j d day of october or tisti while other equally as eminent such as scaliger and spanhcim would have us date from about thefirst of september or ebul it is evident however that their calculations have all j been made long subsequent to creation and ns such are involved in doubt philosophical and mathematical calculations which arc the only true sources irom which authentic in formation can be derived long since failed toj harmonize and as it isa matter ot no peculiar interest to us we need not waste our lime in following the airy notions of others into i lie abyss o despondency but let us attend to matters more susceptible of development and such as arc more easily and readily ascertained and when ascertained are of more importance to us we find in the great work of creationj that when god by his infinite wisdom hadi spoken into existence this immense fabiic he stood in the midst thereof and pronounced i it good ut ihe great masterpiece of his work had not yet been performedthe great i human machinery had not yet been put inaction no mortal voice had been beard to lisp the praise of him to whom all praise belonged then god said ixt us make man and by his own hands he formed man out of the dust of the earth and breathed into lus nostril the breath of eternal life and while man was sole possessor of the earth for into his hands all beings both animate and inanimate were committed god in his compassion moved in his behall and caused a deep sleep to fall upon him while from his side he look her the guardian angel of his every care and we might here be allowed to remark that in this the wisdom of god was most wonderfully displayed evidently intending to show the nearness and close alliance of the one to the other and a direct confutation of the miserable doctrine so universally and so erroneously indulged in of womans inferiority toman woman was not taken from the head nor yet from the feet of man but from his side and as from his side was she taken so by his side shall she stand and with him shall she walk despite the stupid fanaticism of those who would ignorantly undervalue her worth we are led in taking this cursory view of creation to behold with wonder the beautiful and multiform works around us and no man unless he be clothed with a inind of sensuality and skepticismunless hebe dead to every principle of humanity and lost to every vesiige of sane reasoning could or would even dare dispute the existence ol an infallible and living god the superstructure of whose hands meets our astonished vision at every gaze unlike the works ol art the more it is explored the more it opens to our view sources of admirationthe more it calls for our inspectionthe more it demands our praise aud whether we turn to the right or to the leftwhether we at aglance encircle within our vision the green clad valleys or the rustic mountain tops or whether with john in paimos as a sea ol glass we behold the waters of the mighty ocean and ihen in our imagination penetrate the ethereal blue and like the adopted son of pharaohs daughter lay hold upon the shining garments of a deity and hold communion therewhether on pisgahs spicy brow we view the landscape oer or from mount carmel the home of the prophets we gaze upon the wayworn pilgrim as he descends as a herald of salvation while the dews of heaven glisten upon his garments or whether we turn our eyes from those delightful scenes and consent to listen for a moment to the frantic wail from the dismal abodewe cannot but exclaim in the language of the psalmist how wonderful are thy works o i thy ways are past finding out the philosopher may here find an unfunded field of pleasure aud delight the mathematician may here vainly endeavor to calculate the innumerable blessings of god while the poet may sing with ecstacy of delight the sacred anthems of eternal praise and when men upon earth have tuned theii harps nd raised their highest notes angels with propriety may become enraptured with delighttheir heavenly choruses raaj swell the song while unutterable joys shall nog through the mansion of eternal bliss and then tn the language of the poet his love can neer be told and were we to appeal more directly to christians they certainly would agree that to them tins field presents iudf clothed to the richest verdure of heave ow o ordaining f them every brook sparkling at the mountain base becomes a beacon and every pebble on the bed of the chrysul stream a meaaeoger to point them to ie zna of promise god in the economy of his w isdom having thus beautifully and gloriously formed ow scenery hr which we are surrounded must of course have had some definite and primary object in view and suet wan none other than the happiness of man and the glorifiea tion of himself such mj friends was the greet end in view and for this was the forms tion of all this vast nod mighty globe the whole paraphernal and machinery of gods entire universe has been consummated for this oos important purpose and in view of this then bow great and important is the responsibility resting on ns we are thus naturally led to inquire how shall man serve the great end of his creation how shall he serve to promote the happiness of his fellow man and the glorification of god we answer without alluding particularly to spiritual duties that it is the duty of man to seek to promote the interest of bis fellow man by endeavoring in every respect m ameliorate and better his condition our earthly prospects and ambition the objects of our highest natural attammems our most sincere and devoted purposes so far aa they comport with justice and reason should be cored for and regarded by a the very construction of our natures demands this of os as an imperative obligation and where we fail to conform to itwe virtually set aside aod by our actions deny the great end of our creation we should be careful to advance the interest of each other by bearing aach others burdens wc should endeavor to aid thosej in distress we should administer to the wants of the needy we should extend the helping hand and mingle the sympathising tear with those in adverse or afflicted eirenm j stances and thus in our hands prosper the great cause of humanity and might here remark that one of the i rrrat means for the attainment of such endai is that for which your society has been form jed the grand principle upon which your institution has been based is that of the dissemination of light and knowledge you have organized for the purpose of thrusting in the sickle of truth and mowing down the base meadows of corruption which too often ripen in our midst and should you be led on to a successful terminus you may safely be said to he one of the springs from which emanates the true character which shall honor his creation by seeking the happiness of man and the glorification of god education is the great moral leveler it elevates the downtrodden to a position sufficiently eminent while it reduces the proud and haughty to the same eminence pride arrogance deceit and superstition are compelled to lice from before it or in its onward course it will crush them to pieces and fiery darts from the magazine o wisdom shall consume the last atom thereof education is the summary of light knowledge i and understanding the natural promptings thereof are peace union love and harmony the religion of jesus christ in a great measure owes its happy and heavenly progress to education our domestic and foreign missionary societies afford abundant evidence of this fact the herald of christ who folds his bible to his bosom and launches out upon the pacific fulfilling the divine command of go ye into all the world and preach my j gospel to every creature must not only be endowed with the grace of god but must also have a plentiful supply of wisdom from i the storehouse of earthly knowledge and j the same is true of your domestic missiona j ries your ministers of the gospel your laity as well as your clergy and men in all the va tious ramifications of society need in a great measure this inestimable boon in otder the more successfully to complete the great end iof their being and it is a fact that religion andfeducation are so closely allied that without the latter the former cannot successfully bespread while upon the other hand the latter is greatly indebted to the former we learn i that the preservation of the entire code of dead languages may be attributed to the zealous and unreserved efforts of the ancient i christians they collected and preserved with great care the original versions of the old tes i lament which in more modem times have i been translated into our various languages iand become the savour of lile unto life to many that have believed and obeyed the truths herein contained shortly after the return of the jews from the babylonish captivity ezra j collected as many copies as he could of the sacred writings and out of them all prepared a correct edition which was published in the chaldee character that language having j been substituted for the hebrew the division of the scriptures into chapters is of more modern date and was introduced during the ieign of henry the third about the year i about the year mordecai nathan a learned jewish rabbidrew up a con r cot dance to the hebrew of chaldaic bible i and having observed hugos division of chapters and being desirous of still more improvement he divided chapters into verses which i method has been followed to the present time bus we find that the jews borrowed the division of the holy scriptures into chapters from the christians while in like manner the i christians boriowed that of chapters into verses from the jews remove education from our land and wha would be our condition l our halls of jegisla tion and judicial tribunals would become doubly base and corrupted for no man is competent to administer

as well as judgment had never shone oar moral luminary would be i coroe darkened and the light of equity which now measurably illuminates the horizon would i become entirely extinguished no man is i fully prepared to take his station in society under any circumstances unless to a greater i or loss degree he becomes educated it is true he may pass through his home circle be may be respected by

its workmen are continualj building upon jt yet its walls hare scarce been reared above the ground and time alone will complete the edifice it requires more workmen the dej maud is made upon every one to assist in carrying up the walls and when this is done when every mao as the beating anvil to the stroke has been true to his duty and when generations shall bare spent their pilgrimage in adding to this structure then shall be unfolded new duties and generations succeeding generationsshall be called upon to add taste and behold you lofty temples whose spires pierce the clouds and by their dazzling beauty invite the inspection of heavenly seraphs and we trace their commencement back to the apostolic age to the days of andrew peter james and john the despised but bumble fishermen of galiiiee in obedience to the divine couimad of theit savior filled with zeal and perseverance they went forth to establish and build up the christian church of which jesus christ was the foundation ana at that time corn cribs and palm shades of the region of judea were their only temples but nerved by ambition they persevered continually increasing in power and might while through the channels of education have been opened daily improvements and we now instead of the corn crib behold the massive temples in whose courts may be sung the praises of our great creator j the rapid strides that education and science have made through our land might almost be said to be incredible were it not that our eyes behold the glory thereof but comparatively a few years ago and the power of steam in navigating our waters wa unknown while the cities of the old world and islands of the sea which were then faraway have by this agency been brought nigh and distant lands dedicated to heathenism and idolatry have seemingly been brought within our own borders while the power of moloch has been smitten and the nappy influences ol christianity have been shed around the art of printing this powerful engine of reform has but for a short time been known and the good effects arising therefrom are indeed incalculable our railroads our canals and our more modern improvement ol the telegraph all combine to show the power iof science and education and it would be i vain for us to undertake to calculate the many benefits which are the natural and legitimate results thereof but suffice it to say that the performance of what was once considered impossible tias now become universal anti ail these together with the royal thrones of the jd world in all their splendor and the great rollossal

their character and free and humane in their principles this is an age of progressive improvement and under the present circumstances you might as weli undertake lo snatch the moon from its orbit or disrobe the sun of its mantle of glory as to undertake to stopj the machinery now in action bringing about by its daily revolutions new scenes to be looked upon with wonder and admiration iand befoie the glory of this republic shall depart or before her joys shall bo made full a new chapter shall be revealed a new event shall be commemorated and a bright star shall glisten in her diadem freedom to

half a dozen common tnen and affected a plain blunt otfhand manner of speaking he was not overstocked with discretion and consequently sometimes got involved in unpleasant scrapes from a inch he generally escaped by acting the part of a bully although like many brawling blusterers he was really deficient in true courage once however he found himself in a predicament caused by his imprudence and folly where his swaggering air could not save himwhere even liis impudence forsook him and he felt and looked like an arrant poltroon apta in huffnott was passing along one of the streets in cape

with ruffnott and they predicted that evil would grow out of his foolish and insulting remarks but ruffnott himsell manifested indifference as to the result and probably as a cloak to his feelings was quite merry on the occasion and continued to peretrate his gibes and jokes at the expense of the blacks during the remainder of his walk hie legerdemain was nearly ready for seaand an hour or two

more of you theres no mistake in the matter iti all right heaven grant that it may be so murmured the frightened captain ai at a signal from the officer a couple o stout fellows seized ruffhott by th collar and without much ceremony forced him from the quay while theii hard knuckles compressed his windpipe in a most uncomfortable manner the poor fellow as he was forced away cast a despairing look at his coin pan ions whicn said as plainly as a l can say farewell i wonder if shall be shot or hanged and there was reason for alarm christophe the king of the northen part of the island was noted for hi ferocity and recklessness of humai i life he was a friend and officer o toussaintand in the early period othe insurrection distinguished himsei iby his courage and conduct he wai governor of cape francois when th i french expedition under general le clerc arrived at that portand it wai by his orders and under his immediati direction that the city was abandonei by the blacks and totally destroyed bj fire he remained faithful to his friern and patron as long as there appearec any prospect of successfully contend n g against the french after tous saint had been captured througl treachery and spirited away to europe where he met a lingering deatli in the dungeon of a castle in the mountains of switzerlandwhen the dread tul diseases incident to the climate hac sweept away the french troops by thousands and among them the commander of the expeditionthen christophe joined the bloodthirsty dessaline iin expelling the white men from the island success attended their efforts and dessalines was subsequently rei cognized as the emperor of hayti rut he was a tiger in human form and executions and massacres were his i favorite amusements while hei reigned christophe was regarded as an able generalintelligent and brave but not cruel dessalines was assas sinatedand a long and furious war arose for the supremacy between the blacks headed by christophe and the i mulattoes headed by petion after several sanguinary engagements and successes and reverses on both sides christophe established himself as king of the northern and eastern section of i the island and petion ruled in the south and west as presiient of a republic christophe lived in imperial pomp and splendor at ape henryformerly cape francois he was surrounded by guards and his palace or citadel called sans soucie a few miles without the walls of the city was a truly ina i perial residence but now that he had attained despotic power his character was with his fortunes also changed he ruled with a rod of iron i and was a despot iu every sense of the j word many instances are related of his unnecessary severity and of the lowestitnate which he put on human life and now captain rufinott was summoned before this terrible despot and it is not perhaps surprising that his heart failed him he was well paid for his folly in attempting to pass for ai bold dashing fearnothing fireeater i he knew that christohpe was more friendly to the united states thaii to other nations and was desirous of keeping up a close commercial intercourse with our country but he also knew that he was a determined sanguinary villain who would hardly be restrained by such considerations from wreaking his vengeance on any individual who had given him offence and then he sought to conjecture why he was thus summoned before the black monarch his suspense however was not of long duration for he was soon ushered through a regiment of grinning blacks into the polace of sans soucie rich lydressed officers were there in abundance reclining on settees or chain or passing in and out of the various joomsthey regarded ruflnot when escorted into the spacious ball with a look of supreme contempt as if he was a being of inferior race and indeed ruffnot at the tune overcome with terror would gladly have acknowledged their superiority and bowed down before them and solicited their compassion and favor provided such a course iim have secured him from harm and hastened his return unsepthed to his good old brig the legerdemain christophe gazed freely die fmor dejected yankee for a few moments while diabolical write overspread hit ebony feature he seemed to regard him with much the same sort of sattefectioo with which a cat eyes a mouse after her claw ia fastened upon the trembling animal ruffiiot cowered beneall that savage exulting glance he could not say a word and would hare sunk upon the marble pavement if be had not been well supported by an officer on each side after enjoying deeply the confusion and evident agony of the imprudent yankee the emperor in clear well modulated voice and intolerably correct english said in a tone of cutting sarcasm so captain you would sell me for a slave hey who ia the master now and who is the slave t haha ba and his laugh sounded moat unmusically in the ears of his victim you honored me with the epithet of black old thief toome king henry the first what do you say now oh pardon pardon sire be merciful and i will ever bless you murmured ruflhot as he sank ou his knees pardon hey continued chris topbe you have quickly changed your tune captain what a pretty figure you cut now what right have you to expeet pardon from an old black thief who ought to have been strung up by the gills like a haddock a dozen years agohey answer me that ruffiiot did not attempt to argue the question but imploringly repliedoh pardon pardon i will never do so again the grin of exultation passed away from the features of christophe and gave place to a look of stern severity while in a voice of thunder he exclaimed you poor mean contemptible rascal you despise the blacks do you while you have nothing to boast of but your color if i had an officer or soldier as cowardly and worthless as yourself he should be hanged within an hourand you should be shot or hanged if you were worth the trouble or if there were no other means of getting rid of you you are unworthy of the country or the race to which you belong general ettiene said he to an officer who stood near take this fellow beyond the walls of the palace and dismiss him see that he leaves the port within twentyfour i hours and if he ever dares to exhibit his inilkandwater visage again in any part of my dominions cause him to be hanged without ceremony the officer bowed and led away the yankee captain rejoicing that his insignificance saved him from immediate death he followed his conductoi with alacrity for he recovered his physical powers quite rapidly after he had retired from the presence of the black chieftain general ettienne waited upon him until he had reached the entrance of a narrow and rather steep path leading to the city and then giving him a sturdy kick he sent him heels over head on his way shrieking with pain but congratulating himsel on his escape from worse punishment capt ruffnott reached the quay with a limping gait and his mind evidently much agitated he gave vague answers to the questions which were anxiously put to him by his friends and hurried on hoard his vessel with all possible dispatch the next morning by sunrise the legerdemain was under way and when ruffiiot found himself outside the forts with a leading wind and enough of it he drew along breath shook his fist at theisland which he was leaving and muttered j sundry impotent imprecations against christophe and his murderous black j satellites he inwardly resolved however that no thirst of filthy lucre should ever tempt him again to visit aplace where the african race had got the weathergage the adventure although an unpleasant one was nevertheless of service to capt ruffnott it taught him prudence in his intercourse with strangers it taught him to put some restraint on his language and to indulge less in a vain vaunting strain it gave him an insight into his own character placing some traits in a light which he had never seen before and although he would never acknowledge it he learned a lesson of wisdom from king christophe which was of great advantage to him trom that time down to the present day the fate of christophe is recorded in history he ruled over the inhabitants of a goodly portion of the island for about ten years with all the power of a despotic princeand lived in a style of barbaric pomp and magnificence not often witnessed in these days he wnß well acquainted with the character of the blacks nd following in the steps of his former patron and chief toussaint one of the most remarkable men of the age established many rules and regulations which were of a highly heneticial character he interested himself in the cause of education and effected much towards improving the agriculture and commerce of his kingdom but his ferocity and cruelty seemed to increase with his yearsuntil not only the people but even his soldiers became disaffected and entertained thoughts of rebellion yet the wonderful energy of his character his ra litary talents his sagacity his power and the fear of bis vengeance were so great that for a longtime all submitted to his will even after the sable chief was regarded with disgust and hatred by the greater part of his subjects at length christophe was attacked with rerious illness which was the signal of rebellionnod a general revolutionary movement took place he could not take the field in person and the rebels triumphed even his guards turned their arms against him and his palace of sans souci was besieged by thousands of his own troops in this duenunn christophe finding that all whs lost and probably knowing that any attempt to nogociate or temporise with rebels would bo useless commit tod suicide by blowing out bis brains with a pistol bullet a few minutes afterwards the palace was entered by the enraged rebels the lifeless body of the king was treated with shocking indignities and his two soos princes who were highly educated and accomplished were sabred and bayooetted without mercy by the infuriated rebate
