argument of charles sumner esq against the constitutionality of separate colored schools in the case of sarah c roberts vs the city of boston before the supreme courl of mass dec continued the courts of massachusetts have never recognized any discrimination founded on olor or race in the j administration of the public schools but have recognized the equal rights of all the inhabitants there are a few decisions of our court bearing on this subject but they all breathe one spirit the sentiment of equality animates them in the casef of commonwealth vs davit mass r while declaring the equal rights of all the inhabitants both in the grammar and district schools the court said the schools required by the statute are to be maintained for the benefit of the whole town it is the wise policy of the law to give all the inhabitants equal privileges for the education of their children in the public schools nor is it in the power of the majority to deprive the minority of this privilege every inhabitant of the town h a right to participate in the benefits of both descriptions of sshools and it is not competent for a town to establish a grammar school for the benefit of one part of the town to the exi elusion of the other although the money raised for the support of schools may be in other respects fairly appor tioned in the case of fvithington vs eveleth pick the court said they were satisfied that the power is given to towns to determine and define the limits of school districts can be executed only by a geographical division of the towo for that purpose a limitation of the district which was merely personal was held invalid this same principle was again recognized in perry vs dove pick r where the says towns in executing the power to form school districts arc bound so to do it as to include every inhabitant in some of the districts they cannot lawfully omit any and thus deprive them of the benefits of our invaluable system of free schools the constitution the legislation and the judicial decisions of massachusetts have now been passed in review wo have seen what is contemplated by the equality secured by the constitution we have seen also what is contemplated by the system of public schools as established by the laws ol the commonwealth and illustrated by the decisions of the supreme court the way is now prepared to considet the peculiarities in the preseut case and to apply the principle which w have thus recognized in the constitu lion in the laws and judicial decis ions iv the exclusion ot colored children from the public schools open tc white children is a source of partial inconvenience to them and their parents toj which white persons are not exposed and is therefore s violation of equality the black and the whit are not equal before tie law ll appears from the etatement of facte that among the rules of the primarj school committee is one to this effect scholars to go to the school neares their residence application for ad miesion to our ectioole with the exception and provision referred to in th proceeding rule are especially enti tied to enter the schools nearest tbeii residence the exception bore ii of those for whom special provisioi has beet made in separate schools that is coloredchildren in this rulewithout the exceptiot right is of no sextruth is of no color it seen a part of the beauty of our public school system it is the boast of england that justice through the multitude of courts is brought to every mans door it may also be th boast of our public school system that education in boston through th multitude of schools is brought to every white mans door but it is not brought to every black mans door he is obliged to go for itto travel tor itoften a great distance the facts in ths present case are not s strong as those ot other cases which have come to my knowledge but here the little child only five yean old was compelled if she went to the nearest african school to go a distance f feet from her own dwelling while the nearest primary school wa only feet and in doing this she would pass near no less titan five different primary schools forming pan of our public and open to white children all of which were closed to her jsurely this is not equality before the law this simple fact ia enough to determine this case if it be met by the suggestion that the inconvenience is trivial and such as the law will not notice reply that it is precisely of that character which reveals distinctly an existing inequality and therefore the law cannot fail to notice it there isa maxim of the civilian duntoulin whish teaches that oven n trivial fact may give occasion to an important application of the law modica enim cir cumstantia facti indued magnum juris dirersitatim also from the best examples of our history we learn that the insignificance of a fact cannot obscure the grandeur of the principal stake it was a paltry tax on tea laid by a parliament in which they were not represented that aroused our fathers to the struggles of the revolution they did not feel the inconvenience of the tax but they felt its oppression they went to war for a principle let it not be said then that the inconvenience is so slight in the present case as not to justify the appeal i now make in behalf of the colored children for equality before the law i tnay go however beyond the facts in this case and show that the inconvenience arising from the exclusion ol colored children is of such a character as seriously to effect the comfort and condition of the african race in boston the two primary schools open to these children are in belknap street and in sun court i need not add that the whole city is dotted with schools open to white children the colored parents anxious that their children should have the benefit of education are compelled to live in the neighborhood of the schools to gather about them as near the east people come from a distance to rest near a fountain or a well they have not practically the srme liberty of choosing theii homes which belong to the white man inclination or business or economy may call them to another part of tht city but they are restrained on account of their children there is no such restraint upon the white man for he knows that wherever in the city inclination or business or economy iiibj call him be will find a school open this children near his door surel this is not equality bofure the la or if a colored person yielding t the necessities of his position remove to a distant part of the city his children may be compelled at an inconvenience which will not be called trivial to walk a long distance in order t enjoy the advantages of the school in our severe winters this cannot be disregarded by children so tender in years as those of the primary schools there is a respectable colored personam told who became same time since a resident at east boston separated by the water from the main laud there are of course proper public schools at east boston but none that were then open to colored children this person therefore was obliged t send his children three in number daily across the ferry to a distant african school the tolls for these children amounted to a sum which formed a severe tax upon a poor man this is the conduct of a colored parent he is well deservingof honoi for his generous efforts for his children as they grow in knowledge they will rise and call him blessed but at the same time they will brand as accursed the arbitrary discrimination of coler in the public school of boston which rendered it necessary for their father out of his small means to make such sacrifices for tbeir education such a grievance even independent of any stigma from color calls for redress it is an equality which the constitution and laws of massachusetts repudiate but it is not on the ground of inconvenience oaly that it is odious and this brings me to the next point v the separation of children in the public schools of boston on account of color or race is in the nature of caste and is a violation of equali ty the facts in this case show expressly that the child was excluded from the school nearest to her dwelling the number in the school at the time warranting her admission on the sole ground of color the first majority report presented to the school committee to which reference is mnde in the statement of facts gives with more fulness the grounds of this discrimination saying it is one of races not ol tolar merely the distinction is one which the almighty has seen fit to establish sad it it founded deep ia the rochester n v friday february physic mental and moral natures othe two races no legislation no s cial customs can efface this distinction words more ajt than these t describe the heathenish relation o caste could not be chosen this will be apparent from the verj definition of caste this is borrowed from the portuguese word cotta which signifies family breed race it is in india that is is most often applied it is there that we must go in order to understand its full force a rewriter or the subject says that it is not only a distinct inby birth but it is founded on the doctrine of an essentially distinct origin i the different races which are thus unalterably separated itoberts ot caste p this is the ver ground of the boston school commit tee but this word is not now applied foi the first time to the distinction betweei the white and black races alexandei humboldt in speaking of the negrne in mexico has characterized them aa caste and a recent political and juridical writer of france has used tht same term to denote not only the dis in india but those of oui own igpntry charles comte traitt de legislation tom p in the course of his remarks he refer to the exclusion of colored children from the public schools as among the humiliating and brutal distinctions by which their caste is characterized itis then on authority and reason that we apply this term to the hereditary distinction on account of color which is established in the public schools ol boston it is when we see this discrimination in this light that we learn to appreciate its true character the brahmins and the sudras in india from generation to generation were kept apart if a sudra presumed to si upon a bra mins carpet he was punished with banishment it is with a similar inhumanity that the black child who goes to sit on the same benches at school with the white child is banished not from the country but from the school in both cases it is the triumph of caste but the offence is greater with us because unlike the hindoos we acknowledge that men are born equal to be continued from the national standard right op buffkege citizens in addressing you in favor of a disfranchised portion of the legal taxpayers of new jersey i feel from the success our enterprise has already been crowned with that intelligence humanity and justice may be styled characteristics of the citizens of this state knowing then that i atn speaking to an and humane people who believe in that noble sentiment set forth in the declaration of independence that all men are created free and equal c i take the liberty ot speaking freelo to you being one of the disfranchised and i do not believe your hearts are so callous as not to listen to the voice of the oppressed although the above declaration declares that all men are created free and equal those noble words in their common acceptation do not and cannot apply to me disfranchised people i am now speaking of because indirectly you deny the disfranchised are men you say all men are created free and equal and at the same time you deny that equality which is nothing more nor less than denying our manhood if we are not free and equal according to the declaration of independence we are not men because all men are created free and equal we confess there is something about this we never could understand weare denied our rights as men at the ame time are taxed in common with yourselves and obliged to support the government in her denunciations it we are not men why are we dealt with as such when we do not pay our taxes or when we infringe the laws whenever we become a delinquent in theone or a transgressor in the other there is then no question about our manhood we are treated as men to all intents and purposes if we are men when our taxes are due and men when we transgress the laws we are men when our taxes are not due and when we do not transgress the laws there are many reasons why colored men should be enfranchised we have been reared in this state and are acquainted with her institutions our fidelity to this country has never been questioned we have done nothing to cause our disfranchisement on the contrary we have done all a people could do to entitle them to be enfran chised it is said there is not sufficient intelligence amongst us to warrant the restoration of those rights and that we are not sufficiently acquainted with the government fee but they do no say we have not sufficient intelligence and knowledge of the government to warrant us to pay our taxes because we cannot thoroughly understand how the money goes if we who have elwaye been with you do not understand something of the regulations of tb country how miserably ignorant are the thousands of voters who arrive in this country annually who know nothing of this government and but little of any government there to no just plee and apology for you to shut every avenue to elevation ad than complain ot degradation what eua can be expected u fretm while we are looked upon as things and treated worse than unthinking animals in the reaolution colored soldiers fought side by side with you in youi struggles for liberty and thire is noi a battlefield from maine to georgia which has not been crimsoned by out blood and whitened by our bones in a bill passed the legislature o mew york accepting the services oi colored volunteers in the battle on lake erie commodore parry fleet was manned chiefly by colored stamen many black sailors served under commodore mcdonougff when ue conquered on lake many were in battle tnalu burgh and sacketts harbor gen jackson called out colored troops from louisiana and alabama and in solemn proclamation attested to their fidelity and courage but sums of our enemies say we had better go to africa we ask why they say we cannot rise in this country the prejudices are too strong to be overcome that we had better be kings am ing beggars than beggars among kings as ueither ol the positions is enviable we will not quarrel about the beggarly or kingly conditions we think thess titular philanthropists who try to make the people believe we can never rise in this country and that money must be raised by appropriation or otherwise to expatriate us would do well to hold their peacegive their extra change to the pooremigrate to the countiy of their forefathers as quickly as possible and take their incendiary reports along with them they say this is not our country we would ask who does it belong to if this country is yours and was gained by conquest then we are parliceps criminis and are equally entitled to the spoil africa is urged upon us as the country of our forefathers if this is good sophistryand we think it will pass then it follows that all men must go to the country of their forefathers in this case the blacks will go to africa and the whites to europe and where will the mixed races go we suppose in such an event they would occupy the intermediumihat is the mediterranean sea what would become of the indians would they go to the country of their forefathers if so whereis it this sophistry is not aesigned to aggrandize any but the descendants ol european nations africa is the country for the africans their descendants arid mongrels of various colors asia the country of the asiatics the east indies the place for the malays patagonia the country for the indian and any place the white man chooses to go his country the country a man is born in is his country and the humanity that would oppress a colored man for a white mans sake is no humanity for us and the man that will refuse to assist suffering humanity on account of color i undeserving of the name of man think no longer that we cannot understand and act as men we do not need another mans ears lo enable us to hear or another mans eyes to enable us to see nor do w require another mans reason to enable us to think or another mans legs to enable us to walk the faculties and senses are bestowed upon us as upon yourselves and the inan who favors a system that prohibits us from hearing a lecture or seeing an exhibition that restrains our reason by shutting up the avenues for information and that prevents us from passing certain imaginary lines to visit a sick mother ora dying wife do transcend the proper bounds of men and belie that noble sentiment that declares all men are free and equal our design in speaking frankly is not to upbraid you but to show you our maltreatment and ask you to ameliorate our condition by giving us our rights we apprehend no unkind feelings from an intellectual people ignorance and prejudice are the monsters we have tograpple with your present happiness and prosperity in this country result from your having the elective franchise if you were deprived of it as long as we have been you would be degraded also we ask this privilege that we may be prosperous and happy we never could become rivals the meagre proportion that we bear to you in numbers is a sufficient guarantee against rivalry we are willing to stand by the people of this country among enemies and friends in prosperity and adversity in peace and ia war all we ask is to be treated as ms j s rock father mathews letter to judge lumpkin richmond va dec hond and dear sir when you condescended to address aa invitation to pay the illustrious body ovel

and supporters of the antislavery movement rnet at the music hall in this town at a public tea meeting to afford mr brown the american fugitive slave an opportunity of addressing them on the subject of slavery and to present him wiih a testimonial of their esteem and regard between four and five hundred sat down to tea the rev j pringle was called to the chair he congratulated the meeting upon the circumstances under which they had met having amongst them an indiv dual belonging to a race of men who hid long been unrighteously and cruelly oppressed he believed the cause they had rnet to advocate was of the highest importance and intimately connected with the moral and religious advancement of society the rev t pottenger participated in the general feeling of satisfaction at meeting mr brown on the present occasion and giving him a cordial welcome although there were many things in our own country which as a patriot and a christian he deplored one of the things that endeared it to him was that it was the land of the free aswell as the brave all kinds of slavery deserved universal censure but that was the most outrageous which was pa ronized and propped up by professing christians mr brown on rising was enthusiastically cheered he fell thankful especially to the ladies of this town for the kind manner in which he had been received as a representative of the slaves of america long before be arrived in this country he had heard that newcastle wds headquarters for antislavery in great britain and when he returned he should follow in the footsteps of others in giving his humble testimony to their efforts not only in behalf of the american slave but in the cause of freedom throughout the world he gave an account of the rise and progress of the anti slavery movement benjamin lundie a quaker was the first to raise the banner ol freedom in america in the year and to advocate gradual emancipation for the slave travelling through massachusetts he became acquainted with william lloyd garrison then a printer about years of age who assisted him in the management ofhtf newspaper but garrison who took a higher ground and advocated immediate emancipation shortly after removed to boston where by means of thr press he first agitated the question h then visited england and returned tc america with that renowned champioo of civil and religious liberty mrgeorgt thompson who in spite of immenct opposition aroused the attention of the community to the enormities of the aye tern mr brown then related the subsequent progress of the abolition move meat down to the present time he was himself indebted to the antislavery society tjf america for the positioc he now occupied it was engaged to employing such men aa frederick douglass as lecturers in supporting fugitive slaves end in creating a feeling which would eventually abolish slavery altogether with the bible for a textbook and england for thi platform he had no doubt of the result j much had hems

or three antislavery songs from mr brown the proceedings terminated froin the massachusetts spy the cloven foot disclosed one day exactly after the election had taken place in the fourth district gen taylors message to congress is permitted to reach us in which the treason to liberty of the administration is fullv exposed that message which we publish today it will be seen not only takes the cass ground of nonintervention in relation to the territories but goes against the establishment of any territorial government for new mexico which shall include that part of that country to which texas has set up an iuiquitous and unfounded claim for the purpose of extending slavery over it texas if confined to her own proper limits is six or seven times as large as the whole state of new yorkvastly larger than any one state ever should be permitted to be and the additional territory she now claims is larger than all new england and includes the capital and best settled portions of new mexico texas as sbe is must inevitably be divided on account of her unwieldy size as a state and the only possible object of giving her more territory would be to extend slavery where it otherwise would not go the new york tribune thinks to admit california as a free state and to leave the settlement of the slave question to the territories themselves is as much as a louisiana planter could he expected to concede indeed so said the free soilers long ago and they said it was all he probably would cooceed and when they said that gen taylors influence would be thrown against the wiimot proviso they were denounced for it but it is now matter of record and all the lying pretentions of the taylor papers about his favoring the proviso are at an end but the tribune very well remarks that although the message concedes as much as a louisiana planter could be expected to conoede it by no means follows that it should satisfy north freemen er their representatives if texas ie allowed to her hi country p wul be to slavery whole no remaining territories of new mexico i ind eastern california then slavery will be introduced there and become astablished tliut when a state government shall be framed the attempt to exclude it will be unavailing m the tribune well says in reference to this question new mexico is this day in m oent peril of subjugation to slavey her people are few scattered effeminate and spiritbroken by conquest texas can crush her in a month if secured annuity in so doing withdrew from new mexico the protection of the fed erai government and texas thrutties her at once bythat act slavery i fow pwliwl op eke qd anns of north latitude considerably further north than it now has a tool hold in any part of the union the swindling annexation resolves indeed hold out a show of excluding slavery north of d but that is a deliberate fraud the resolve only ays such slates as may he formed out of territory north of dm shall be free stales and tvxas and her councilors will take precious good care that no states shall be formed in that way though she should i be split iuto a dozen the triumph of i texas in the pending struggle would give to slavery a new domain larger than jyeto england whereon there is not now a slave and has not been these twenty years there is nothing abstract theoretical conjectural about this matter the triumph of texas is the discomfiture of freedom inevitabty the work of freedom today is the preservation of new mexico and to that every thing else should give way but the wilmot proviso is the permanent medicine of the state the grand heroic antidote for the civil passions that most excite the national rapacity and corrupt the national heart give a proviso that there shall nevermore be slavery in any territory of the union and the south would keep us carefully out of all wars of aggression and conquest thereafter we need that as guaranty of tranquii ty a security against greediness for all time to come nonintervention is a play upon words for what shall be the law of the territory in question prior to any action on the subject by its people may a slaveholder take and legally hold his slaves there if yes then you haqe slavery established under the name of nonintervention if no then you have antislavery and in essence the wilmot proviso why will grave men plav at hideandseek with such terms as this nonintervention mr charles dickenss substitute for public execution mr charles dickens has written a second letter on public executions his positions in reference to their demoralizing nature he states to be firstthat they chiefly attract as spectators the most depraved of mankind in whom they inspire no wholesome emotions whatever secondly that the public infliction of a violent death is not a salutary spectacle for any class of people but that it is in the nature of things that on the class by whom it is generallywitnessed it should have a debasing and hardening influence these positions he supports by his experience at the late execution to prevent such spedacles in a christian country and all the incalculable evils they engender he would have the last sentence of the law executed with comparative privacy within the prison wall from the moment of a murderers being sentenced to death i would dissmiss him to the dread of obscurity to which the wisest judge upon the bench consigned the murderer

some information in reference to this last occasion should be restrained in his unseemly briskness in his jokes his oaths and his brandy to attend the execution i would summon a jury of twentyfour to

certificate tod same in every case that on such a day at such an hour in such a jau for such a crime such a murderer was banged in their sight there should be another certificate from the officers of

scervant jones would any northern christian believe it possible that a true disciple of him who came to preach deliverance to the captive and the opening of the ptison to the bound could assign aa a reason for wishing to sell forty human beings a pious and benevolent desire tobe a missionary mr jones does this and apparently in all sincerty slavery has blinded him in the hope of seeming a purchaser he assures all who read that his forty servants are mostly young and likely and rapidly increasing in number and value he thus virtually claims the right to seize upon and hold as his own every child jhat may be born to any ol those whom he calls his servants and he proposes to transfer that right to the purchaser of his human chattels yet he seems unconscious that iii so doing he is giving the highest sanction in his power to a practice which the scriptures rank among the highest crimesto manstealing slavery has blinded him he takes credit to himself as being willing to tell bia servants at a reduced price provided the purchaser is a kind raaser lie has probably uever thought of the question whether it is possible for one who deals in mortal men as merchandize to be kind and

leisure moment sinct my return to comply with your request had long desired to bo in boston during one of their antislavery festivals but nevei until this season had a convenient opportum ty of realising my wish at the first open ring of the meeting i must confess to somr feeling of disappointment the place of as setnbling was as you know faneoil hall capacious edifice admirably adapted to largi popular gatherings but illy suited for thi business meetings of a comparatively loca society one consequence was in this case that the attendance though quite respectabli tu nnmbers for the beginning of a meeting appeared in the midst of so much unoccupiei space to be discouragingly small added t this was the meagre number of speaker around the platform garrison whose pres nee seems almost indispensable on such oc c isions was confined at home by sickness and it was said would probably not be abl to attend any of the meetings tne foster were absent as were also douglass re mood w

councils of the nation and like the rod of the hebrew deliverer ii has swallower i up all other topics scarcely a day har passed since the meeting of the present cont gress but that the baled subject has been thr theme of fiery discourse our entire exchange comes to us laden with leaders ant speeches on this once obscure and strictly avoided topic the public mind has reaohec a point of interest and excitement unprece denied the sout hdemands the extensior of slavery into ihe new terriiories while the north sternly insisis upon its exclusion but words pass on borh sides and the waver of agitation rise higher and higher it is ai j this juncture that the cifty clay with his characteristic temper and skill has thrown himself on the turbid waters of debate he comes as he is wont to do with that soft and gentle diction and in that spirit of conciliation and compiomise for which he has been so long and so highly distinguished he wishes as usual to revive the expiring embers of to soothe all asperities to allay all sectional jealousies and to knit j the nation into a firmer bond of union he has presented a stung of resolutions to the senate for the purpose to use his own language of making an amtcable arrange i tnent of all questions in controversy between fae free and the slave states growing out oj the subject of slavery this object it must be admitted is a comprehensive one and it displays no small ambition that any one man should essay to accomplish it but let this pass v ill he succeed is the question we think not the plan which mr clay proposes like all southern compromises gives everything to liberty in words and secures everything to slavery in deeds he is most generous in giving away that which he does not possess but is never betrayed into the weakness of bestowing that which he has the power to retain the first resolution of his compromise goes the enormous length of propping the admission of california into the union without forcing her to open her golden j domain to the foul and corrupting system o what s magnificent concession is here ought not every northern man to bow with grateful emotion to the magnanimous man by whom it is proffered this liberal and generous concession to be fully appreciated must be viewed in the light of certain notorious facts the first fact is that i california has already with singular unani raity adopted a constitution which excludes i for ever the foul system of bondage from her borders the next fact is that she has already received from the present administration of the united states goverument especial marks of its approbation another fact is with the growing population of california her vast extent and boundless wealth she is of herself sufficiently strong to command respect witnout asking the favor ol any and ihe last and most important fact ol all is that the north has the disposition and power to admit her into the union with oi without the generous compromise so nobly and complacently presented by that father ol compromise henry clay mr clays proffered liberality is about as noble as that of a highwayman who when in the power of a traveller and on his way to prison proposes a consultation and offers to settle the unhappy difficulty which has occurred between himself and the latter by accepting the half of the contents of his purse assuring him at the same time that if his pistol had not missed fire he might haye possessed himaelt of the whole this assuming to concede as a mark of liberality the right ofa state to enter this union without being compelled to have the foul curse of slavery fastened upon her would be about as ridiculous as it is disgraceful but that the slightest token of concession on the part of the south to the north is hailed by so many doughfaces with marks of humble gratitude the impudence of slaveholders exceeds everything they talk abont the rights of slavery just as if it were possible for slavery to have rights the right to introduce it into the new territories the constitutions right ac shame on such insolent pretensions slavery has no arohrs it isa foul and damning outrage upon ail rights and has no right to exist anywhere in or out ol the territories the earth is the lords and righteousness should cover it and be who concedes any part of it to tha introduction of slavery is an enemy to god an invader of hn dominion and a rebel against bis government the next resolution of mr clay adopts practically the nonintervention doctrine so oniverstlly held up to ridicule by the whig press of th north as the offspring of tbst prince of sycophants gen cass they are tokwa j resolved that the western boundary of the stsie of turn ought to bo fixed on the rio i del norte commencing one marine league from it mouth tod running up that river t the southern line of new mexico thence with that tine eastwardly and oo continuing i in the mow direction to the line established between the united siatee end spain excluding any portion of new mexico wbethei lying on the earn or weet of that river resolved that it be pioposed to the state of texas that the united states will provide i foi the payment of all that portion of the r legitimate and bona jfcfe public debt of that state contracted prior to its annexation b the united slates and for which the duties on foreign imports were pledged by the said r state to its ciditor not exceeding the sum of in consideration of the raid duties so pledged having been no longer applicable to that object after the aaid annexation bu taving thenceforward become payable to tht i united states and upon the condition also u t the state of texas shall by some aol j ema and authentic act of her legislature n of a convention relinquish to the uniteo states any claim which it has to any part ol new mexico no comments on the foregoing resolutions are needed from us we put them on record j merely as links in the chain of this compio b lt will be seen that mr clay does not concede the justice of the claims which b texas has recently set up for a large portion k of new mexico so far so goode tne fifth and siith resolutions are as fol low a resolved that it is inexpedient to abolish slavryin the district of columbia while that institution continues to exist in the stale o ol mjry land without the consent of that state p wiihoqji the consent of the people of the ditrict and without just compensation to the ownets of slaves within thu district but revolved that it is expedient to prohibit within the district the slavetrade e iu slaves brought into it from states or places f beyond the limits of the district either to bt sold therein as merchandize or to be transe ported to other markets without the distiict d of columbia if the abolition of slavery is to depend upon the assent of the slaveholders of mary e lajad and the other contingencies specified ii iacaay to see that slavery la the district ol columbia cannot be reached until the lasi j vestige of slavery has disappeared from tht state of maryland when that event lakes place there will be no necessity for compio mise and so far as these resolutions have any bearing at all their effect will be to cloj the wheels of emancipation it what is said about abolishing the slave a trade in the district of columbia is a mere n rum since the slavetraders of maryland cane easily reside in washington and sell theii slaves out of that city under the very management which pretends to obstruct the trade n while slavery remains in the district and thee r gh to buy and sell is retained by the slaveholders it will be imposaible to suppress the slavftrade there the seventh resolution in the series is at follows e e resolved that more effectual provision ought to be made by law accotdiug to tlu requirement of the constitution for the re titution and delivery of persons bound to set n v ice or labor in any state who may escapi e into any other state or territory in thi union x n hardened as we have had reason tq believi n mi clay to be and inconsistent as he alwayi s is we scarcely expected such a resolution e from him as the foregoing at this time ant k in sucli a connection when the sympathy s of the nation has by his eloquence and tha of others just been wrought up to the great t est intensity for the hungarian fugitives from g oppression that he should propose such i e resolution at suck a time for hunting dowie fugitives in out own land whd are fleeing s from a bondage and tyranny far more terrible than that of austria is almost as shocking tie our sense of propriety as in is revolting to our moral perceptions of rig h t and wrong b ut we give mr clays eighth and las resolution that the reader may judge for him soil as to the benefit which freedom will des live from this mis named compromise tv us the whole seems like the handle of at jugall on one side t resolved that congress has no power it prohibit or obstruct the trade in slavestaiweer the tlaveholding states but that the admia  sion or exclusion of slaves brought from om i into another of them depends eiclusivelj l upon their own particular laws this resolution declares what is not true if there be any meaning in words the con r stitution of the u s does confer upon congress full powers to abolish the slave trad between the states having already extended this article beyond the

seeking to advance or their desire for the continued cooperation of those who have for so many years extended a helping hand or to do more than simply remind their friendsthat the yeai has rolled by which brings them again before the public with the products of thetr ingenuity and industry as solicitors for patronage and bounty on behalf of the sighing bond men it ia hoped that the exertions new

rick douglass ln the north star of the ihjnst find a petition to qaeen victoria from the women of ireland and also a letter from belfast to thyself janat thou spare a little space for a few remarks upon them none can regret more than i that the treaties between brazil and spain respectively and giest britain for the abolition ol the african slave trade have not been fulfilled by the people of the former countries and would rejoice if the british government could adopt some pacific measures to accomplish this grand object but ido not believe that any measure which does not strike at the root of slavery itself can ever destroy the slavetrade one of the fundamental princi plea of the british and foreign antislavery soicety is thus expressed that so longas slavery exists there is no reasonable prospect of the annihilation of the slavetrade ano of extinguishing the sale and barter of bumai beings dtc i believe this a great tiuih which should be kept constantly in view by every laborer in the antislavery cause it is well known that the combined fleet of great britain france and the uniteo slates have not only tailed to put down th african slavetrade but have actually increased its horrors the women of ireland in their petition implore the quecn to require her ministers to adopt such meajurts athey shall deem requisite to enforce the fulfil inent of the solemn treaties with spain por ugal snd brazil for the total abolition of thu nefarious traflße ac thy belfast corre spondenl acknowledges that many peison refused to sign the petition because they considered its language too strong and at indicating the propriety of a resort to wariikt measures this she says we shoulo regret as much as they provided the grealei evil can be removed without resorting to so dreadful an alternative it is evident from this language in connection with this petition that the signers contemplate war against the offending nations at least as an alternative in case other measures fail will not american abolitionists geneially regret that their warmhearted and benevolent irish sisters should for a singh moment sanction the unchristian dogma thai the end justifies the means i like much better than this the memoria to the queen recently circulated in england and now awaiting with signatures ol british women a suitable opportunity foi presentation after portraying the oonlinuec atrocities of the slavetrade these petitioner say but while respectfully directing theii majestys attention to the spaniards and brazilians as the immediate perpetrators of tht crime we cannot conceal from ourselves tht fact that the late enormous increase of tht slavetrade has been coincident with the increased consumption of slave produce in ihit country the sugar act was passed ii and the results are before the world t hut the good and evil how fearfully dispru i purtionale there has been a plentiful supply of cheap sugar in the markets of ihi country and an increase in the slavetrade o more lhan three hundred thousand souls pei annum to produce it but are we so dead t feeling as to desire that the homes of africs should be ravaged to add to the luxuries of i british teatable breathes there a womai in our land who would have her own cuj sweetened by throwing gall into ihe cup of i fellowcreature we are aware that it u difficult to apply a remedy to evils which prevail in countries beyond the jurisdiction o great britain but we earnestly pray tha every legitimate and peaceful means may b resorted to on the part of your majestys go vernuient to enforce on the governments obrazil and spain fbe fulfilments of theii solemn engagements by which they art bound riot to permit another cargo of negroei to be landed on their shores and to give liberty to all those slaves who have been unlaw lully introduced and as nothing can bt more clear than that slavery is sustained b the purchase of its productions we propost for ourselves an immediate and widespreac abstinence from the slave productions of cubi aud brazil and in this we venture to hop for the high sanction of your majestys example and that you will be graciously pleased to exclude these productions from the roya household permit me again to refer to the belfast petition in reference to the fact that the sum of was paid by great britain tv obtain the treaties for the abolition of the slavetrade the petitioners testify their eagei desire to have the bargain which their fathers and brothers paid for scrupulously enforced perhaps the ladies would be startled if they were told that they themselves and their fathers and husbands are now paying the brazilians and cubans for committing the identical act of which their petition complains yet such is undoubtedly the fact agpin the petitioners wish these ungrateful nations spain and brazil may be practically taught without further delay that the british people will not submit to disgraceful fraud this sounds like a noble determination but what does it mean heretofore the british people and the irish have made themselves parties to this disgraceful fraud by purchasing its fruits thus giving ibe immediate pcipetrators the inducement to commit it have they now determined to cease this guilty connection sod no longer submit to be participants with those brazilians snd cubans who disregarding alike the laws of their own governments and the treaties with great britain continue to putchaee those foully wronged and persecuted people the victims of the african slavetrade tor the purpose of supplying the people of great britain and ireland with cheap sugar and coffee i fear their language will not justify an affirmative answer on the contrary it would seem bat rather than banish this sugar and coffee from their table and thus peacefully contribute to effect the object of their petition they would be willing to resort to the dreadful aileron tive of overwhelming the people of brazil and cubathe guilty and innocent alike with the cruelties and miseries of war shall we indeed continue la sta thai grace or liberty raey abound god forbid very truly thy friend samuel rhoads tfc aaaaai meeting of the massed u ailmliwjr society we copy with pleasure from tha liberator the following resolutions adopted st the recent meeting of the old pioneer society they are well draws and instinct with light nd life resolved ttst surprised as we are at the simplicity of the northern press and northern members of congress to urging so incessantly upon southern disuhmmisi that heir course will defeat their object since in tne l mon and under the constitution is the ony security for the permanence and quiet enjoyment of slave property we are still more disgusted st the unblushing impudence with which these same ediurs and politicians rise i rum their servile knees m ask of ihe abuli tionists the suppoit of that very instrument which they have just proved tuba the cornerstone of bondage and a eomlort to the oppressor resolved that we look upoo it as one source of rejoicing even in the atrocious system of slavery that the agitation for its ovar ihrow seems destined to waken to life the torpid conscience of the nationto quicken its sense of justice and to recall pure religion the desecrated temples and whited sepul chres which have so long passed lor its shrine resolved that one chief reason why we enter our lebuke against ihe chubch is that having so long scattered the seeds of retorm she sits still now that the fields arc white for the harvest that she disowns the principles which have sprung from her bosom brands hem as infidel and gathers into her fold those nmid sheep whom she can still govern lest hey be corrupted by the running to and iro and mcteaso of knowledge which her prophets have foretold that claiming to have on her bi east plate of righteousness sue re luses to have anything tu do with the battle claiming to hold the sword of the spirit she keeps it nicely sheathed while other men contend tor the faith once dehveisd to the saints and in view of these facta we pronounce her claim to be the church of christ tu uije blasphemy resolved hat in view of the antislavery progress ot the past year it must be matter of surprise to all coming time ihat in a nation prung from english and puritan ancestry ihe political arena should he the first to iwaken to its duty on a great moral question ind that an agitation like that of amislavery should owe its progress and suocess far mure to the forum than the pulpit to theselfish broils and timeserving motions at washington than to those who assume to fill the pul pus of cooper and mahew and to teach the gospel of christ resolved that we look on the present session of congress as the most useful since the organisation ot the government and consider its character the result not only of u virtue and independence of a tew leading minds there but of that awakened public opinion of the tree states of which wasb mgton is but the echo and this conviction gives fresh animation to the zeal with which we set ourselves again to the work of reeducating a corrupt and besotted people resolved that we seek a dissolution of this uuiou first as a measure of individual duly cease from sustaining a great evil secondly to secure free action and expression lor that degree ot antislavery feeling which even now exists in the nation and which is either soothed by the pride cajoled by ihe professions or intimidated by the power of ihe great national parlies and seels thirdly by abstaining irom all guaranties lu the master to leave ihe balance even between ihe two races fourthly to bring closer to the southern conscience the indignation and moral rebuke of the age now contused and restrained by a fusion of these states and lastly to bring to bear on the institution of slavery hose principles of the relative value of free and slave laboiof ihe unchangeable connection of national prosperity wnh popular progress and ihe elevation of ihe masses winch has swept chaiteiisro tfom europe and will put an end it here whenever the breakwater of this union which now shields the oulh from their reach is removed resolved that in the lamented death of david ruggles we mourn the list of an early active sagacious and persevering friend i the antislavery causeof oiih whose professional ability makes his decease a public loss and whose position and success wete doing much to weaken the cruel prejudice against colorof one whose career proves the power of individual intellect and eiiergy in making their way under the most trying disadvantages of race and position and of personal infirmity and ill health and that we commend ihe con inet and character of dr ruggles to the study of a pro slavery community as evidence of the vigor of a race borne down by so many burdens and to unicolored frieuds as a model the imitation of which cannot fail to secure their elevation and improvement kicoived i hat it is with deep regret we perceive that the poet longfellow has prmti ruled his fine poetical genius to eulogize the bloodstained american union as freighted with the hopes and interests of humanity as being a noble ship invulnerable to the rock and proof against the storm built in the most skilful and workmanlike manner whereas me history of its creation and its cruise demonstrates it to have been n i u berk

anee of a gtoantng world tnr following is a short but happy and and complete reply to the brilliant hallucinations of carlyle on the subjeet of west india emancipation and the character of the negro population of thoee islands the illuminated madcap carlyle should blush in view of his effort to create contempt and hatred towards a people who have already suffered the greatest inflictions ever imposed on any race by pride selfishness and cru eltyr t from the british antishivery reporter mr cailyle whose anglogerman crudities and mystified philosophies have so tickled the fancies or heated the imaginations of not s few amongst us as almost to create a school hss recently so far diverged from his usual course as to inflict upon the reading world an occasional discourse on the negro question the most salient parts of which will be found in another part of the reporter d this production proceeded from any other pen than carlyles we should have allowed it to puss in ailence but because it is attributed to him it must forsooth be noticed now what is the staple of his die course stripped of its inflated verbosity and pul into plain english it affirms that the emancipated slaves of the british colonics arean idle and inferior race of men whom qud hascreated to be tbe servants or slaves of white men who in ihe enjoyment of their freedom are content to live oc pigs food that providence designed them to grow sugar and cojfce sod spices for the rest of the world instead of shaping out their own course and hat if their be no other means of seeurinr this the whip must be employed to compel these indolent two legged cattle to produce noble elements of cinammon sugar coffee black pepper and grey for their born lords in the meantime before the beneficent whip and the wholesome state of slavery can be restored our philosophic teacher suggests that not a square inch of soil in those fruitful isles purchased by british blood shall any black manhold to grow pumpkins for him except terms that are fair to bn tian that is not j pumpkin quashee not a square yard of soi till you agree to do the state so many days oi service in this strain the profound car lyleas be is styled raves on to reply ti him would be simply to reopen the question which the common sense and common conscience of mankind have lone ago settled that the slaveholders of the united states brazil and the spanish colonies will a ware him an ovation there can be no doubt bui that the sensible portions ot mankind will si tach any importcnce to his oracular utterances we can ot for a moment to believe so far aa the emancipated classes in th biiish colonies are implicated m this discourse we beg ty say that mr carlyle delineation f them ia perfectly untrue anr we shall be much surprised if he do not fin more than his match in some of the black quashees of whom he affects to speak will such lordly disdain the negroes in thi british colonies are free no will they evei be reenslaved mr carlyle and the wes india bodythat part of them at leastwhon he so perfectly representsto the conlrar notwithstanding they will cultivate sugar or coffee qr pumpkins as it may please them for masters or for themselves as they may choose but they will be no longer coerced ti do either a sounder philosophy than thai inculcated hy mr catlyle will be found in iht opinion expressed by sir charles grey the present governor of jamaica whu says inone of hit latest despatches the negroe appear to me to be generally as free from rebellious tendency turbulent feelings anti malicious thoughts as any race of laboiers ever saw or heard of my impression is indeed that under m system of perfectly fan dealing and of real justice they will comen be ao admirable peasantry and yeomanry ablebodied industrious and hardworking frauk and welldisposed hitherto they have not had justice done to them they havt not been fairly dealt with yet amidst alt th difficulties ot their position they have advanced and had not they met with the severe check imposed upon them as well a their employers by the sugar act of they would have made greater advances still surrender ot fugitive slaves the readers of the north star have already seen the bill introduced into the united states senate by mr mason of virginia providing for the recapture of fugitiv slaves the subject was again brought up before that body on the th ult and furlhei considered we give below a few extracts from the speech of mr mason together with the amendment offered by mr setvard ol this state on the presentation of thi amendment hangman foote got the floor and be s pane rod mr seward all over with hit wordy indignation and contempt mr seward look no notice of his windy assailant altogether the best course with such an op ponentf n here are the extracts from mr mason speech what are the provisions of the fundamental law ir the fuuith article of the consti tiou there are two clauses providing for tin extradition of certain classes of persons escaping from one slate to anotherclause that lie in juxtaposition conceived at th same time and written upon the same page and each of them i submit not only to senators but to the worldeach of them plain distinct unequivocal in its import and the ends designed to be attained now sir even should t succeed though in a plain and humble manner to direct the attention of th country to the existing state of things n relation to these clauses of the constitution and not startle these people into rebellion against the government of their own stales this law if passed will remain i am afraid a dead letter npoe your statutebook as th present law is it is provided in the fourth article of the constitution as fellows a person charged in any state with treason felony or other crime who shall flee from justice and be found in another state shall on demand of the executive authority of ihe state from which he fled be delivered un to be removed to the state having juris dicton of the crime this is the first clause of extraditiona clause operating in all the statesmade foi benefit of all the states and each of the stites is alike interested in having it exe cited wnat is the other clause no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping to another shall in consequence of any law oi regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor bet shall be delivered up on the ilaim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due clauses sir having a kindred purpose the one designed to effect the surrender ot lugilives from justice the other designed to effect the surrender of fugitives from labor each clause imperative upon the governmem framed under that constitution and upon th states who are parties to it but this latter clause mr presijent which provides for the extradition of fugitives from labor is a clause that accrues to the benefit of some of the states and not to all it accrues to ihe benefit of those who unhappily are now in the minoritya minority not in the number ot slates but a minority in the number of the people the slaveholding states air are alone interested in the faithful and proper execution of this second clause for extradition and we are to look to the majority to execute that law against which their people havi been for more than a quarter of a century in revoltay sir in revolt i think lam warranted then in the apprehension expiessed that no law which can lie passed by the congress of the united slates w ill sfford the remedy which this law is intended to supply unless it is sustained and supported by iht people to whom it is addressed sir let me present another view of this question the clause which i have read was intended upon the faith and honor of all the statesto secute to the owners of these fugitives from labor the surrender of auch fugitives when they escaped into othei stales this is not the only law of the consulution bearing upon slave properly far from it these very stales now non slavehuldiug states when they became partial to that compact not only with their eyes open and their interests awakened conceded to the slaveholding states important privileges and advantages but for which they derived ample equivalents these veiy people who are now so sensitive to freedomwhose unwilling ears will not bear the name of slave these very people negotiated upon the basil of stave property and received ample consideration for the privileges we now vainly invoke why sir they yielded to the southern states a repiesentaiion based upon tbit property they did more sir they agreed by this compact to withdraw from the control of congress altogether for twenty years the right to prohibit the introduction of slaves from abroad and they went further anti bound themselves under the solemn stipulations of the instrument that when slaves escaped from ooe state to another they should be delivered up and for this and every concession they received most ample equivalents they received that equivalent alluded to bj the senator who sits before me the senatoi from south carolina mr btitltaj the substitution of an ordinary majority for a majority of two thirds in all laws affecting commerce and navigation and many of then received still mere extraordinary equivalent ia a concession to all the states whatevei their aise may be of en equality of representation in this body ooe of the greatest difficulties that stood in the way of those whe framed tbit instrument was the demand upor the part of the eastern states or many ol them at least for an equality of representation in the senate and not only was lhi equality conceded but the further securitj was given that such equality should not im destroyed by any future amendment to lh constitution without the consent of the state to be affected by it he again sets forth the rights of slaveholders aa follows now mr president what are the right secured by the constitution to the ipastei whose slave escapes from his service into another state desiring sir to be very sc curate upon this subject i have written dowi what i understand to be the right of the owner in the recapture of a fugitive slave within the limits of any and every state ui ihe union mr m here read from a paper as follows the constitution of the united stale secures to the master the same right of pr perty in his slave and to be enjoyed and exercised to the saim extent and with the same incidents when thj slave escapes to another state which he held in the state from which he fled so fat as recapture is concerned he may take him wherever he is found by virtue of ownership and without any warrant or other process in law none has a right to interpose between thr claimant and the fugitive or to inquire whe the slave be his or whether he is a slave at all far less to molest or hinder him in the capture he may enter peaceablv any enclosure or dwelling where such slave may be found tor the purpose of taking him and this witheut committing a trespass he raav use whatever force may be necessary to eff ct the capture without committing hereby a breach of the peace and if forct e offered by the slave or others he mat iesist it to any extent that may be necessity to secure the possession of his property these rights and this authority are incident to the rights of property attd the law of tltr constitution secures the owner in the exercise of them against any hostile law of the state to which the slave may flee should such law bethe constitution does not confer these rights they are antecedent to the constitution and arise as incidents to property undet ihe laws of the slate whence the slave escapes they have their sanction in the law if the domicil the constitution however as the supreme lw recognizes thss right of property and iarrtes its obligation and its incidents for all ihe purposes of reclamation into every state in the union and makes the law of the lomicil quo ad hoc the law of every state in the union mr seward gave notice that he would at ihe propei time move the following amendment to the bill viz strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the following when any person who shall have been suited arrested as a fugitive from labor under or try virtue of the act af congress entitled annet respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping

the occasion of making a ridiculous low scurrilous attack upon the patties who madi the application we quote a specimen o these proceedings to show that even among honorable men there may sometimes creep a creature so low and vulgar as to disgrace a company of rowdies mr flaw begged leave to aak the gentle matt bow letting mtaa mott come in here would have the effect to dissolve the union  laughter mr momsoi am glad mr speaker t see things taking a playful turn here and thank my friend from king for bit contribution to a result which without his aid j per bape alone could not bate achieved i air want to run due dung into urn ground ajtf break it off air yea air break it off now aa to mias mott airof whbm i know noth ingsince hei name has been mentioned bj my friend from kingl msy be permitted to reply that whether her coming in her with a colored man would dissolve the union has nothing to do with the point am driving at but that if it hadl sa it without meaning any offenceit might lead to that onion with which i hive nothing to do roars of laughter which the speaker could with difficuly repress sir let me tell gentlemen in perfect seriousness and candor that i have a deep and abiding conviction derived from letters addressed to me fiom various quartets and from my own knowledge of the effects ui this slavery agitation that the cnutse we are pursuing in that direction we shall all of ua find reason when per ha pa it shall be too late to regret i do not believe air that there ia anv want ot patriotism here but do believe that there is a want of a proper appreciation and conviction of existing and impending danger and i do hope air that we shall not have mias mott and what ia the other mans name asked mr m of the gentlemen about him under a burst ol laughter at the phrase other man tom iatt he continued hope sir we shall not have miss mott and tom dick and hairy com i mg on this floor kindle up aoew the flame ol abolitionism this individual who writes to the speaker i understand is a colored man am prepared to say that he will not m thie hall with himself as chairman and mias molt aa secretary reecho sentiments on this slavery question akin to those ot certain gentlemen herebut not thank god to me the speaker here asked to be allowed to state the application the chair understood mr burleigh to be a gentleman who had lectured extensively on slavery and on the subject of peace a voice on what l on the subject of peace he was expected here tomorrow and the church where he was expected to lecture being engaged the use ol this ball wa asked for that mr burleiuli might lecture on slavery if it was the wish of the citizeus of aibany to hear a lecture on peace also they would piobably be gratified mr monroe sir i am very glad to hear that he ptoposes to lecture on peace slavery i propose to lecture on myself lighter sir i should be veiy glad to have the gentleman from orleans mr burroughs go in and hear that lecture on peace laughter he told us the other day on this floor that if the question ever came to be one ol slavery or peace he desired no peace i hope sir lie will go in and listen to the lecture on that subject mr burroughs interposed the gentleman did notcorrectly state ins language mr monroe i shall not misrepresent the gentleman took down his words but my notes are not here the gentleman may rely upon it that i shall give him an early opportunity to withdraw them mr burroughs did not withdraw one wotd the speaker called to order mr monroe had no doubt he was out of order for he was speaking on behalf of the union the speaker the question is on granting the use ot the hall mr monroe i understood the speaker to say that the lecture was to be on the subject of slavery or peace and i was stating that on the subject of slavery propose to lecture myself mr l yv smith moved that the use of the hall be granted to the gentleman to deliver a lecture on slavery laughter mr monroe the gentleman need not trouble himself i am obliged to him but my constituents have made it entirely unnecessa rymy constituents have given me a seat here m constituents who have an abiding attachment to the constitution and who are in favor of the unionihey sent me here have a right speak without any special permission i have only to say that have confined mysell to the resolution as far as possible i hope me use of this hall will not be granted except for purposes connected with legislation in which all of ua take an interest i am opposed to granting the use ol this hall for all purposes and esperially for the purpose of allowing mus mott and my friends friend to lorrn a union here laugh ter mr l w smith said that such applications were not unusual a few days since the use of the hall was granted to an agent of the colonization society last year to a colored lecturer on slavery this hall was the property of the people and the spirit of our institutions favored the dissemination of light and truth the gentleman was mistaken if he supposed he could change this practice it j seemed to be the drill of the gentleman from new york to alarm the house with a dread of the action of the south and seemed to have seized the occasion of this simple motion to grant the use of the hall to an individual ot whom he knew nothing he hoed leave would be granted the precedent haa been established and it was now too late to dta i criminate j wo give the following extract from a letter of our esteemed friend gerrit smith published in the liberly party paper it respects the recent general antislavery convention at syracuse we insert it with much pleasure as an act of justice to him in view of our strictures on his course in that convention thu morning of the second day broughta chatge against mr foster he convinced me that it was false i expressed my rei gretat having brought it and fullv rettacied it have no doubt that mr ster was rightalthough the president and every one ot the many with whom spoke on the subject had understood him as had but we were mistaken mr foster whom believe to be a man of truth knew his own wotds and their intended meaning better than we did the evening of the second day offered two resolutionsfeeling just aa liee to offer them as it i had been in a liberty paity convention at that lime i neither asked nor as my noble brother douglass has it demanded the vote of either the convention or the assembly upon them i confess however that immediately after i had com down from the desk to my seat i did join in the call of many voices for the vo e of the assembly confess too that knew that the enrolled members alone had the right n vote but the great assembly evinced mud eagerness to vote w hy should it not b graified i confess moreover hat i war curious lo know how that large company ol whigs and democrats be sjc viewed my resolutions over and oved again sairi that the vote of the assembly would not bethe vote of the convention and that the convention would be to no extent responsible lor it that this vote can he defended by paliamentary or other rules is not to be claimed it waa an irregular proceeding and i at all blameworthy do not disown my shut of tbs blame the morning of the third day mr pillsbury made a speech i was charmed will ita beauty and vigor there waa however a passage in it which was exceedingly offeu sive toliberty party men rose and protested against tt instead however of re uacting it he said to me if the cap fin you you can wear it i should not hav risen but that i supposed mr ptllsburv intended to abuse and insult us liberty ratty men have since been assured by mr may and mr burleigh that he intended im such thing and that tie was only expressing iu strong and figurative language bis cunvtc tme ural the american

believe to be so devoted a friend of the slave one of our pleasant recollections of the late convention is that not one word was said in it to irapogn the raotivee of any friend of the american antislavery societynot one word to call in question his sincere devotion to the cause uf the slave another such recollection is thai with so few exceptions all was kind and agreeable on the part of

dissolution predicted ihe political unions i i massachusetts and new york are spoken of as fruitless in their results and the free democracy is severely rapped for allowing the defeat of mi palfrey who the report says is the righiful head of the political party opposed to slavery the fact is stated that for eleven years an escaped slave has not been recaptured in massachusetts and this is attributed to the antislavery agitation fugitive slaves our readers will remember the last great contest over a man claimed as a fugitive from slavery before judge edmunds of this cay the slave was arrested by a mr lee rum maryland without piecept and gagged and chained and would have been taken out of the stale had not mr lee been stopped by the arm of our state law the slave so called wan brought before his honor judge edmonds on habeas corpus and discharged on the ground that mr lee could not prove that maryland was a slaveholding state he proved that he had held him as a slave but failed to prove that such holding was authorized by the law of maryland it appears from the following that the slate is taking up the case important movement a resolution passed the house ot delegates yesterday authorizing the attorney general of maryland to test before the supreme court if necessary the lower of a magistrate ol newyork city in discharge from custody a fugitive slave the case in

written by alfred crowquill our limits will not permit us to give the long and less interesting introduction but will simply say that a moderately wealthy but very happy and contented country gentleman had gathered his family and friends around a bright and ruddy fire on christmas eve and inaccordance with his long established custom relates the following story you all know the sheep sheds in our lower croft by windy gap said he before i built those sheds when it first came into my possession i had often endeavored to reclaim it but atter many vain attempts i gave the obstinate bit up in despair and put it toits present use it is a desolate looking nook and in its appearance carries out to a miracle the scenes of happiness enacted upon its site william mawby was born there of parants well to do in the world with everything about their farm in a thriving slate as a mere child he was ofa peevish solitary nature this i have heard from good authority for i only became acquainted with him as i entered my first school and he was just on the point of leaving it consequently when i returned home for good to my parents roof he was a grown man and i a mere stripling as so short a distance divided his fathers farm from ours i soon fell over him and renewed our acquaintance his occupation was a foreshadowing of his miserable character he was diligently inspecting a hedge that divided a close from the main road he thought that he had discovered evident traces of some one having passed into the field through the said hedge i laughed at his wise and serious face drawn into a loik of profound wisdom for so trifling an occasion my young friend said he men are ruined by trifles it is not the broken hedge i value but i suspect the trespassers passed through that gap on some unlawful purpoes but ill be even with them now my suspicions are aroused i with that he tapped the side of his nose and went on his way most suspiciously uncomfortable tne next aay to the amusement of the village u large board appeared staring over the hedge with the announcement ofall sorts of penalties and spring i guns to the unwary trespassers his old father was a merryhearted plain old man who never put himself under the infliction of doubts for he believed that men were all petty considerably honest as the world went and he had not the slightest idea that ne was better thati anybody else consequently he smoked his pipe in calm contentment and let the world wag his suspicious son soon disturbed blissful equanimity for much to his annoyance he found padlocks placed j upon things that had hitherto been open i to all his neighbor had to wait for his glass of ale while he found his son n and his son found the key for he was not always sure where he had hidden it poor williams principal torment was his suspicion of his own father his lynx eyes soon fathomed the soft easy temper of his parent and saw a thousand ways wherein his disposition might be turned to account by the cunning dealers on market days when the ale was uppermost at their simple friendly dinners in winch the old man delighted and which it would have been difficult to wean him fromas though yielding and good natured he was too tough and independent to be dictated to by anybody another painful thorn in his side was an aged aunt lo whom the old man took a well stored weekly basket she lived on a small stipend in the market town she had two daughters the old man often took his sobering cup of tea with them on his return he might leave them something comfortable the thought was tormenting his suspicion carried him every market day to dodge his father with the show of sincere affection which the unsuspicious old man with his heart glad reported to his simple dame who rejoiced with him over their imagined treasure he was at the time about eight and twenty and dodge as he would he could not escape a pair of bright eyes and rosy cheeks that caught him in the before mentioned market town on one of the suspicious visits he soon scraped an acquaintance after having by great assiduity found out that her father was a retired miller of good fortune and that she waa an only child he thought this a safe investment his position and appearance soon gained him pernfission to continue his visits which were in tact continual for he was always under the apprehension that when the cat is away the mice will play and that some other might snap up his valuable mouse he did not feel quite assured about the old mans possessions so made it his business in a thousand tortuous ways to make inquires this could not go on quietly but it at last reached the old millers ears who good naturedly put it down to the young mans prudent foresight but on inquiry he discovered that it proceeded from a doubt of his respectability and veracity the miller was a shrewd old man but whether the young suitor might not be wanting in some of the qualities he thought necessary for the girls happiness the old banker was a chum of the millers through whose instrumentality he had invested large sums in excellent mortgages he allowed himself to be pumped by mr mawby with the connivance of the miller and consequently by winking replies to hie eager inquiries made out the miller to belittle less than insolvent williams affectioas sank down to zero awho it had for months been burning according to hit own account like two or three etnas combined his suspicions then were true what aa escape thought he so it wm for the fortunate girl he proceeded to bis intended ones boose it being dark he crept over the garden palings and sneaked up towards theshuttir he vainly attempted to peep through the crevices here while endeavoring to make out a murmured conversation in which he thought he heard his name mentioned he was pioned by the millers dog who poor brute was cursed with the youths fault of suspicion and suspecting that he was a thief had seizedhirn accordingly here was rather an awkward denouncement and he had no right there the path to the door lay another way in his anxiety he had trampled down the flower bed he stammered out some excuse upon his release and departed home crest fallen hoping that they did not suspect his suspicions the next morning he received avery polite note from the miller begging him not to repeat his visits as the dog appeared to have taken a sudden dislike to him in which he was joined by himself and daughter at the same time to ease his mind as to the state of his affairs he begged to say that any respectable young man who pleased his daughters taste might have loooo down on the wedding day and as much more at his death for once william suspected right viz that he had made a sad fool of himself not many years after this he lost his simpleminded mother her death gave him plenty of exercise for his miserable faultfor he was continually laying traps for the servants as if they had been so many mice to catch them out in their little speculations uutil his espionage mude all around him so un coinf triable that many of the old domestics left the farm in disgust whenever he met me he was full of some deeply laid plan to and out some miserable suspected one and often in the midst of his selfsufficient tale he would start off on a sudden without any apology because a suspicion had flashed on his mind that he had not locked his corn bin or preserve cupboard before he had left home his whole occupation seemed to be to find out things that would make hinr uncomfortable the food preserved for his own table he constantly dotted or nicked that he might see upon theii being brought to the table again mhe ther any one had ventured to purloir even the smallest particle he had a habit of laving straws ir keyholes that would be displaced upor the slighest attempt to insert a key and discover the intended thief i havi known him to walk to a considerabli distance and then return and push tin door to assure himself that the lock ha shut he once got in his own trap on night late he nad an engagement to gi to some neighboring dance so he sen all the servants to bed and locked th front and back door and to make al secure hid the ponderous key on hi return he could not for the life of hin think of the hiding place he therefor had some hours to walk up and dowi in the night air before the day dawn when the imprisoned servants discovered him feeling about in hen coops anunder hatches lor the missing key a last his hidingplace struck his memory and he had the mortification c withdrawing it before the tittering servants who thus discovered his suspicions and the retribution on himself ii his long night watch his father who had now grown to aged to attend the farm left it entirel under his control his suspicion had nearly finished him offfor h suspected during his harvest that hi shocks were pulled and robbed in th night he therefore hired b clown t sit up as a watchman armed with ai old doublebarrelled gun loaded will slugs the first night his suspicion would not let him sleep this watchman might be bribed to connivance am he get laughed at he was soon dressed and creeping along the hedge where his suspicions were verified b hearing low murmuring voices hi crawled close in their vicinity am there i i covered that it was the poo fellows wife who had brought hin something comfortable for his supper he crept back cautiouly but stumblinj over the root of a tree roused the attention of the watchman who dial lenged him immediately he lay stil for a moment hoping he should escapi observation in the darkness of tin night but upon his first attempt to raisi himself lie received about a dozet slugs in his arm and back for hit watchman was a better shot than hi suspected the picking out of lhes by the village surgeon was a positivi satisfaction to the many to whom hii character had become pretty wl known thus he went on until his father death left him entirely alone for hii suspicious mind never allowed him t form a friendship which can only b true and valuable where there is i mutual confidence and an openness o character he by his suspicious nature had locked himself within himself which is the most fearful of imprison ments his fathers wealth enabled him t please his fancyso to set hismind a ease he sold his farm that he might as he thought be freed from a hest o pilferers he built himself a house iu the croft mentioned at the beginning of the tale the very prototype o himself it bad a most suspicious lit bad but one door but windowi were placed so that he could see a that was going on no every side he bad only one domestic an ole cripple without relations who was to lame to go out and of course had n visitors it was well known in thi neighborhood that he had withdrawi large sums from the different country banks where it had been invested bj his father and it was strongly believet that he kept it in the bouao as be sue pected that

crept on him but wandered about like an unquie spirit around his selfimposed tomb in the course of time bis old do mestie was conveyed to the vulagi church yard much less solitary that the abode which she had left fora moment the old man atoot and gazed after the bearers his whin hair blown about by the cold wintry wind and his shrivelled hand shading his eyes he turned slowly away from the sight and closed the door many were the kind offers from the simple people of the village but all offers he resolutely declined as he sue pected that his age and wealth were calculated upon to a nicety and a thumping legacy looked forward to as the reward of some trifling attention distant relations began to hover around him and make tender inquiries these he always met on the doorstep which was his only audience chamber for such callers that solitary old man sat as longas day lasted at a window everlooking the high road here he passed his life in reading and watching the same wiudow showed a light burning throughout the hours ofdaikness for he always appeared upon his guard as upon any person approaching nearer thau usual to the premises his ears were saluted by the deep growl of his dog who never led the house any more than his master about two years after the decease of his housekeeper the nightly light was missed from the window for it had become quite a guide to many coming to the village this of course caused some oi the more curious to approach the house by daylight and reconnoitre but there sat the solitary old man apparently deeply occupied with his book and also his god peering through the glass this satisfied them and they departed a week had elapsed and the village was alarmed by the appearance ol mawbys dog careering in a wild man uer through the villageupon being noticed he sped hack to the croft many followed him and upon approaching the house and luok ng up at the window they perceived the old mat still sitting unmoved though the frame had been smashed by
