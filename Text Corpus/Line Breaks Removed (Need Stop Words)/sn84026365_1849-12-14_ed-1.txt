letter from william w brown london nov d to wendell phillips esq dear friend i observe in the american papers an elaboratetliscussion upon the subject of passports for colored men what must the inhabitants of other countries think of the people of the united states when they read as they do the editorials of some of the southern papers against recognizing colored americans as citizens inlooking over ome of these articles have felt ashamed that i had the misfortune to be born in such a country we may search history in vain to find a people who have sunk themselves as low and made themselves appear as infamous by their treatment of their fellow men as have the people ol the united states if eolored men make their appearance in the slave states as seamen they are imprisoned until the departure of the vessel ll lliey make their appearance at the capitol of the country unless provided with free papers they are sold for the benefit of the government in most of the states weare disfranchised out children are shutout from the public schools and embarrassments are thrown in the way of every attempt to elevate ourselves and after they have degraded us sold us mobbed us and done every thing m their power to oppress us then if we wish to leave the country they refuse us passports upon the ground that we are not citizens this is emphatically an age of discoveries but i will venture tile assertion that none but an american slaveholder could have discovered that a man born in a country was not a citizen of it their chosen motto that all men are created equal when compared with their treatment of the colored people of the country sinks them lower and lower in the estimation of the good and wise of all lands in your letter of the th ult you ask if i succeeded in getting a passport from the american minister tn london previous to going to paris to attend the peace congress through the magnanimity of the french goverriment all delegates to the congress were ted to pass freely without passports did not therefore apply for one but as i intend soon to visit the continent and shall then need one i called a few days since on the american minister and was furnished with a passport which the following is a copy if it will be of any service in the discussion upon that subject you are at perfect liberty to use it legation of the united states of america in england passport vo the underaigned envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states of america at the court of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland begs all whom it may concern to allow salffly and freely to pass and m case of need to give aid and protection to mr william w brown a citizen ol the united states going on the continent given under my signature and the unprint of the seal of the legation in fjondon oct the th year of the independence of the united states for the minister john c b davis secretary of legation so you see iny friend that though we are denied citizeuship in america and re used passports at home whan wishing to visit foreign countries they dare not refuse us a passport when we apply for it iu old england there iso public sentiment here that hardhearted as the americans are they fear when will the americans fleam that if the north star they would encourage liberty in other countriesthey roust practice it at home if they would inspire the hearts of the struggling millions in europe they should not allow one human being to wear chains upon their own soil if they would welcome the martyrs for freedom from the banks of the danube the tiber and the seine let them liberate their own slaves on the banks of the mississippi and the potomac if they would welcome the hungarian flying from the moody talons of the austrian eagle they must wrest the three millions of slaves from the talons of their own they cannot welcome the wanderer from the battlefields of freedom in the old world as long as the new world is the battle field of slavery should the kossuth and the wimmers t visit america they would be reminded of their friends they left in chains in austria by the clanking chains of the americau slave when we see the efforts that are made in america to spread slavery over new territory and to put back everything like emancipation we must admit that our country is in a deplorable condition but this instead of discouraging us should make us to labor with renewed zeal we must not give the americans any rest until slavery is abolished there was a time in the history of athens that the people wanted the passage of more wholesome laws and to keep their wishes before the lawmakers they wrote them upon the wall of the city until they gained their point we will not write our wishes upon the stone wails in america but we will write them upon the hearts of the people of the entire world until we shame the americans into good man ners i was asked a few days since at a meeting if was not afraid that the abolitionists would become tired and give up the cause as hopeless my answer was that the slaves cause was in the hands of men and women who intended to agitate and agitate until the iron hand of slavery should melt away drop by drop before a fiery public sentiment yours for the slave wm w brown mr clay on slavery and the new territories mr clay reached baltimore from philadelphia on thursday last and met with an enthusiastic greeting the baltimore american after giviifg a glowing account of his reception says at oclock yesterday morning mr clay in accordance with previous arrangement took his position between two of the parlors on the lower floor othe lioletr both the capacious rooms were immediately filled almost to suffocation and the wish being loudly expressed from alufarts of the room that the venerable matesman should address them mr clay gratified them by making a few remarks after referring to the warmth of the reception which had greeted his arrival here and the strong evidences of friendship evinced towards him by those who then surrounded him mr clay proceeded to remark so far as our memory serves us for the crowd prevented the taking of notes that the gentlemen of this city who had directed the letter to him had referred in connection with his return to the senate to the grave questions which had yet to be settled there great threatening and alarming questions wnich had arisen out of the war with mexico and the annexation to our republic of territory formerly belonging to that country all who were acquainted with these territories he thought must have reached the conviction to which his own mind had been brought that under no possible circumstances was slavery likely to be introduced into the territories of california or new mexico the climate the character of the country and its inhabitants and their industrial pursuits all forbade the likelihood of slavery ever being introduced there that question had however divided the people to an unexampled degree and created animosities to a most lamentable extent on the one side the prohibition of the introduction of slavery into these territories is urged with a resoluteness and perseverance which would indicate that those who urge it really believe that if this prohibition is not passed slavery would be introduced on the other hand the prohibition is opposed with an energy and a perseverance that would also seem to indicate that with them the belief exists that if the prohibition be not passed that slavery might certainly be introduced but gentlemen said mr clay i appeal to youis there under existing circumstances any probability that the institution of slavery could be introduced into these territories indeed so far has the excitement growing out of this question arisen as to threaten the dissolution of the union might have consulted prudence by saying nothing in reference to these exciting questions bat asyou have referred to them in your letter have deemed it proper to thus notice that reference and i would further say that on one point stand pledged under all circumstances and in all stormsthat is to stand bv the unionenlbusi astic applause in its dissolution i cannot see the remedy for any evil whether real or imaginarynothing nothing could be gainedall would be lost byit by the diasolution of the union i see introduced with it all the calamities all the misfortunes and all idle horrors of civil war cheer untangling foreign alliances by the severed portions of the union would follow dissolution and warsbloody desolating and continued wars would succeedfuntu some bold and unscrupulous military chieftain should aaize the right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren liberties of all and convert the whole into one militaiy despotism we should then need no history of oureountry but all that had been written in that of greecein that of her phillip and her alexandermight be read as applicable to us renewed and continued applause from tbe oberiio evangelist state of jamaica the correctness of one position which i have taken in showing the state of things in jamaica is questioned by some and i wish to look at it and explain a little farther i sayas the cultivation is devoted almost exclusively to exports and the wants of the people are supplied by imports the true state and prospects of the islaud may be very nearly determined by comparing them for a given year and by comparing each one year with another i am asked does this follow of course it is acknowledged that in astate of slavery it would probably be true but not in a state of freedom on the ground that the emancipated may consume a fnuch larger part of the productions and be in a prosperous condition though there should be a large falling off inhe exports and that the imports might vary greatly and yet the island be in a prosperous condition i am not here discussing the comparative comfort of the inhabitants of jamaica under the system of slavery and freedom if i were to take up that question in the series of articles i have commenced many of the facts i have brot forward to show the commercial and agricultural state might then be viewed in another light on that question i should show that the emancipated people at least the majority of them have gathered around them very many comforts to which they were strangers in the time of slavery except as they became acquainted with them in the aggravated manner of seeing others enjoy them at their expense i should show also that the people consume much more of the products of the island than they did formerly ido not however see but my statement is substantially correct since the peoples consumption of their own products will not give them means to pay for the surplus of imports and those imports are ino permanent stock which forms realestate or in any way increases the wealth of the island but are for the current consumption of the island aod are really consumed by the inhabitants the falling off of imports would not argue the want of prosperity but the contrary if the deficiency was supplied by boir productions ttuljcbua iltt met by the capital of the island or for the want of capital which is available for such purposes the surplus of imports becomes a debt in the shape of mortgages in the hands of foreigners we think there are decided signs of decay unless a foundation is laid by the process for a resuscitation of capital to meet those debts i see no way in which this is being done unless it is in the discipline the inhabitants are passing through to prepare them for wiser and more economical management in the future yours truly wm h evarts baptist gagging for antislavery opinions from the concord n ii independent democrat andrew t foss has been excluded from the salisbury association this is a matter for new hampshire antislavery to mark it is no sectarian af fairit looms above the confines of the baptist denomination into the region ol common humanity it is extracathedral no sect no party no church no country can confine the antislavery cause how can the salisbury baptist associ ation this is no personal quarrel between foss and the salisbury association anymore than sectarian the phylacteries of his creed are as broad as the mosl popular divine among them hie moral character unquestioned his stature as full his form as comely as when his hand penned theitrecords his chirography has not changed for none of these things do the association care the president of the baptist state convention thinks he is a christian and would go to heaven anhonorable man but his course injurious to the cause of christ and the salisbury association exclude himfor what because he will plead the cause of one hundred and twentyfive thousand brethren of their own faith who are robbed of their dearest rightsand degraded to the level of beastsbecause h will labor for three millions of human beings crushed under the ponderoui wheel of american slavery i call upon the antislavery men and women ol new hampshire to note this that in the person of a t foss whom the baptists of new hampshire have spurned they are scoffed at and scorned and the cause they have cherished as the apple of their eye is spit upon and despised the salisbury association have closed their doors against the faithful foss let he heart of every abolitionist be opened to him welcome brother to our heart as longas you stand upon the platform of antislavery i will not flurry myself abort the high heeled soles of your theology if my toes are not crowned into the same fit and the cowhide boots of creed are not used to grind into the dust the already downtrodden dart i will stand side by aide with men of ell creeds and colors to labor for mankind though stand only on the cuticle hardened by use that god ban given roe and venture to proffer you the welcome of the abolitionists of new hampshire invite you to the convenuoo ol free souln the country throughthe rochester n y friday december world over yes sod when that great convention shell assemble end when they shell coos from the north end die south from the east end the west to sit down in the kingdom of god christ will invite you to e seat with the angels and all the just made perfect to reign with him forever the cause of antislavery is a duration cause and it becomes all true lovers of christ to notice how the archfiend of this sham republic is scaring the consciencee of the professors how he is gagging their mouths and pressing them into his servicetake the baptists as they are just now in oar minds see bow they ere joined with slaveholders on one side and striking numb those who would undo the heavy burdens on the other side the american baptist missionary unions constitution and treasury are open to slaveholders although there isa pretended separation the constitution of the union says all the members of the baptist general convention who may be present at the adoption of this constitution shall be members of the union other persons may be constituted life members by the payment at one time of not less than one hundred dollars there is no prohibition hery or anywhere else of slaveholders and their money the only requisite for office is members in good standing of regular baptist churches here they invite merr who buy and sell the image of god and keep their brethren in a worse condition than heathen to participate in their meetings and labors for evangelizing the distant heathen and in teaching them a slaveholding religion while a t foss is excluded from their sympathy for his antislavery faithfulness it is not only through this union that slaveholders are recognized as christian but by fellowshiping the american foreign bible society and the publication society and by sending an agent in the slateholding states the past year to collect funds for the union treasury i merely allude to these facts to show the true position of the baptist professors who are attempting to vote down antislavery in the person of brother foss i leave him to enlarge upon it i know that it is pretended by most of these sectarians that they hva the cause of the slave near at heart how much they love the cause will appear from the following extract from an account of the n h baptist state convention by one of its members the convention was held october eld worth of fisherville presented a paper containing rules of order for the obsfervahceof the convention there was nothing of special interest in these rules except the fourth this was substance as follows when any subject shall be brought before the convention and any member shall object to its being discussed the president shall immediately put the questionshall this subject be discussed if the convention vote in the negative no discussion shall be had thereon as the question oi adoption was being put objected to the rule ist as unprecedented in any deliberate bodies civil or ecclesiastical in our state d as destructive of sound rights in its operation i called the attention of the convention to the operation of this rule in our state legislature which is strongly democratic that the rule would deprive the whigs of the right to speak at all upon any measure however they might deem it of vital importance unless their democratic brethren might by courtesy vote them the indulgence that no political party in the state would desire such unrighteous advantage none would submit to it that it had been tried in our national congress and after a brief life of infamy it had gone to the grave to be remembered only with mortification and regret no reply was made to my remarks i did not expect itthe subject would not have borne discussion ten voted for it fewer against it and so the rule passedand will show to the world the singular and humiliating fact that the miserable rag of despotism which some years since was torn from the back of the american congress has been picked up by the n h baptist state convention and for one year at least at most i hope she wears the shameful deed a report was read by eld wright chairman of the committee on the a fc foreign bible society highly commending the society moved to amend the report by adding at the cloae the words we deeply regret that this society sent the pest year an agent into the alaveholding states to collect funds for its treasury the motion being seconded i commenced some remarks in support of the amendment but here the convention found an opportunity to try their new made fourth rule and it worked admirably closing am lips in silence previoos to the enforcement of the rule elder wright had said we bad no evidence that such an agent had been sent to the south l proposed to ask the agent elder seaver who only a few days before bad acknowledged the fact and expressed bis regret that the society had so done it was at this point that the rule was applied it was a case where it was greatly needed the agent of the powication society was received with great pleasure and every facility was granted him to promote the interests of bis society a report w made on this society hy prof e fr smith commenting the society tom churches of the stale now this sect tw may manner whatever separatee iron slaveholders the society is now sail ever has been connected with the fiashj mongers of the south in jibe closest fraternity thera was present the astral somber of agents eld cnmßcott represented the northern baptist education society and the missionary union elder seaver the bible society eld fuller the home missionary society elder metcalf the publication society end eld piper and myself the free mission society each of these agents bad time appropriated to them to advocate the claims of thair respective societies i moved that brotbsr piper be allowed fifteen minutest some of the agents used more than an hour but i asked but fifteen short minutes for brother piper to be beard in setting before the convention the condition and prospects of the missions connected with the ab f mission society but they voted an emphatic no there were other developments bearing upon the same point which cannot be presented in one article christians and abolitionists ponder these facts endbe stimulated to renewed exertions truth wit prevail though salisbury association ao pass resolutions and baptist conventions enact gag rules h o s fextension of slavery letter from mr foot of mwusippi to mr cungman of north carolina washington november sir being casualty informed ofjour recent arrival in this city i seize the opportunity of invitiog your attention to a subject of high importance to the whole country and of especial concern to the southern states of the confede racyone of which you have the honor to represent in the councils of the nation the session of congress is almost at hand and indications are abroad and every moment multiplying which seem to render it quite probable that the wilmot proviso and the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia will be again brought forward either in the senate or house of representatives and supported by the zealous and unscrupulous advocates or these mischievous measures with increased violence and confirmed pertinacity it is most evident to me that the union itself will be put in serious leopardy by the movements thus menaced as i hold it to be certain that no state ofthe south will patiently acqui ssce in cither of the aggressions alluded o i regret to perceive that there isin erroneous impression widely prevalent tat the north that the south is neither in earnest nor united in any icheme of opposition and resistance to he insulting encroachments now so lercety thrsnd it lhim imprsssiqn s permitted to remain uncorrected un il either of the meditated outrages referred to shall have been perpetrated t is to be feared that it will be to late o save the republic from consequences oo dreadful to be contemplated witb ut a feeling of patriotic solicitude and ilarm whereas it is my firm convic ion that if the the sober thinking men f the free states could once ascertain he danger that demagogues and fanat cal agitators are fast bringing upon hem and their unoffending brethren of he south by the advocacy of schemes rf injustice and oppression which cannot possibly result in practical benefit to any section or state of the confederacy they would rise up without further delay and say to the agents of sedition who have heretofore i sported with their credulity and abused their confidence that the period has at length arrived when they will no longer permit them in their name to trample the sacred provisions of the constitution under foot aud embroil the legislative councils of the nation in unseemly and wicked controversy taking this view of the matter and knowing that you have had an opportunity of conferring freely during the past summer with pour fellowcitizens of north carolina venture to lay before you the resolutions recently adopted by the southern convention of the state of mississippi and eall upon you to say whether or not you approve of them and whether they are in your opinion approved io the state of north carolina and the south generally being a prominent member of the whig party you will doubt lesa feel authorised to apeak in language too explicit to be misunderstood as to the probable action of our political associates in the south shook the present seetional contest be carried to extremities in the convention of mississippi you will observe both the two great political parties of the country were equally represented the resolutions unanimously adopted by that body may be therefore regarded as declarative of thefriews and feelings of the whole state however it may possibly be elsewhere i can assure you mom confidently that the people of mississippi look upon the slavery question in its existing aspects as above pasty lam satisfied that this is the condition of things generally in the soetb and i hope that you will feel justified in expressing a concurrent opinion  bad the honor of addressing a few days since inquiries similar to those now propounded to you to your distinguished colleague the hon willie p maogum who proposes so soon as the physical indisposition with which heis at present afflicted will permit to declare bis views on the whole subject ina hmm m mrti nt v anna a some worn ennweaiorn iam gratified tn know and to he specialty authorized to state that he felly and warmly approves the proceedings of ear mississippi convention as was certainty to be expected from ooe always ready heretofore aa be has been to defend the honor and safety of the south against aggressions either ac t j teal or meditated from whatever quarter they might emanate i have the honor to be very cordially and respectfully your friend anc obedient servant k s foote hon thomas l cuxcxax reply of mr chngman to mr foot citt or washington not dear siryours of the th ust baa been received in which you ask my own views as well as my opinion as to wbat will be the course of the south in either of the contingencies referred to your position as a representative of one of the states and the consideration due you personally merit alike a prompt reply having on former occasions given my views in detail with reference to the whole subject it is not necessary fur me to do so at tvs time i proceed therefore to give you simply the general results of iry reflections the federal government because it is the goverrment of the united states is the trustee and agent for all the states and their citizens every dower therefore which it can ightfnl y exercise it must of necessity exercise for the benefit of all parties to i the territory of the united states being the common property the government is bound to administer it as far ns practicable for the benefit of all the states as well as their citizens a difference however exists among them in relation to the institution oi slavery when the constitution was formed twelve of the thirteen states were slaveholding that instrument though it has cluuses expressly inserted for the protection of the rights and interests of slaveholders contains no provision for the abolition of slaver anywhere if the government therefore can properly exercise such a power in any instance it must be because j its duties as a general agent acting so as to meet the interest and view of it principals require it but fifteen of the thirty states of the union still nnin tain the institution of slavery it isj obvious therefore that the government could not consistently with its powers as a general agent exclude the slaveholders as a class from nil participation in the enjoyment of the territory pf the united lt is on the contrary under srlemn obligations to respect the rights of all it lias always j heretofore as i understand its action shown a sense of this obligation when the muchtalked of ordinance was adopted by which the territory north of the ohio river was made free all that portion of the country south ol the river to the gulf of mexico was toft to beimrajtted uy slaveholders when slavery was abolished in the northern part of the louisiana territory the southern portion regarded as most suitable for slaveholders was left so to be occupied on the annexation of texas when a provision against slavery north of deg min was incorporated much the larger and more valuable portion was still left for the use of slaveholders but now it is proposed to adopt the policy of excluding slaveholders ns such from all the territory of the united states this would be an entire revolution in the action of the govern menta revolution which could not ocj cur without a total violation of the spirit and essence of the constitution since those citizens who do not own slaves are permitted to occupy every part of the territory of the union it has been doubted by many whether the j government can rightfully exclude slaveholders from any portion of the j common property but even if there should be a power to divide the public territory for convenience between the two classes it is perfectly clear that there can be no right to exclude one j class entirely i have therefore said that i should regard such an exclusion as being as great a violation of rhe constitution as the government could possibly commit but even if this action should be viewed simply as an enormous abuse of power it would not bethe less objectionable the government has unlimited powers in relation to the establishment of post offices throughout the union if however it were to withdraw all the post offices from the aiaveholding states on the ground that the citizens of those states were not worthy of the countenance and aid of the government we should j have as much reason to complain of such action as if it involved a clear infraction of the letter of the constitu tion j in a word if the government should adopt the policy of excluding slavehol dera as such from all hie territory of the united stales it ould in soh j stance and effect cease to be the government of the united states while the form of the constitution might remain the same its character would be essentially changed ought the southern states to a cqui esce in this great organic char ge in oor political system ought they to remain members of an association which had in utter disregard of plain constitutional guaranties degraded them from their position of equality as history furnishes no record of any peophr who bays prospered after they bad forfeited their selfrespect by submitting to be degraded to a state of political vassalage hold it to be the doty of the southern states to resist this change that resistance to be effectual should bo commensurate with tbe riofenee of the attack this they owe to the cause of constitutional lib to justice and to their owe honor j with reference to the nhohtkm of slavery in the district of columbia i will simply say that waiving all eoe john dict prtfw whole no j troversy m relation to coqstitattenaj r ghl arid obligation to the adjoining state if such an event were to occur at this time it would not tike place inobedience to the wishes of the citizen the district but would be brought about at the instahe of the inhabitants ot the states but these persons have no i jnht to control the local affairs of this district should congress therefore thus act at their instigation it would be guilty of an act of tyranny so insulting and so gross as to justify a withdrawal of confidence from such a government you ask in the second place what i believe likely to be the course of the south should such a contingeny occur there was but oneof tbe states having any considerable number of i slaves in relation to which i had any doubts from her position and the powerful influences brought to bear upon her i had some fears as to what might be the action of kentucky but i have been gratified beyond expression by the gallant siaod which that noble state has recently taken she has thereby shown that she will not abandon her sisters in tbe hour of danger but that she will if accessary take the front rank m the struggle for the preservation of the rights and liberties of the white race of the south he union of both parties m mississippi is a type that will occur elsewhere the southern states ought to have but one feeling on this question as they can have but one destiny i have no doubt but that over the entire south there vvoujj be a vastly greater unanimity than existed in the old thirteen slave states when they decided to resist british aggression if a few individuals should attempt to take a different course they would be swept away in the general current long before the trouble should come to the worst the south would present an unbroken front i am net aware sir that in making so brief and concise a statement of my views i incur the risk of misconception and misapprehension but i should eel that i did not appreciate the momentous nature of the subject if i could attach consequence to mere personal considerations very respectfully your obedient servant t c clingman hon h s foote p s since the above letter was written it has been submitted to my colleague mr mangum ortd he concurs lolly in all its general conclusions and avows his purpose to make known his views at length at an early day and entertains the opinion that the federal government has no power to legislate or tle subject of slavery either iiffhc states or territories and tnat all precedents whether legislative or judicial because adopted without due consideration are not obligatory t c c flora the snmoeky mirror the southern gamelook out already the word has gone forth that calhoun and his followers wiilep pose the admission of california as a slate because the proposed constitution prohibits slavery south of deg  m the line of the missouri compromise of course they will but only for securing their grasp upon desa ret and new mexico any quantity of bluster will be let off in opposition to the admission of california until doughfaces enough can he found lo admit deseret and new mexico with territorial governments containing no prohibition of slavery to that end the whole influence of the taylor administration is directed no matter whether slavery is prohibited or not is already thew hig shiboleth and the south will compromise thats the word by admitting california if they can stave the jefferson proviso from twcatbjkds of the territory we repeat in solemn conviction that this will result in a usurpation of those territories by slavery as for new mexico it adjoins teas it is exposed to arkansas missouri and other southern emigrations u s officers already hold slaves there and the south are willing to run the risk of riveting slavery on the soil if they can have that territorial government containing no provision on the subject w ell how is it with deseret which claims a western boundary on the th parallel of longitude and wilt probably be suffered to extend to tbe sierra nevada in degr thai people have already adopted a territorial government utterly silent as to slavery and new mexico wc have reason toto fear will present a similar draft at the next session of congress do you say that slavery will nst go into deseret it has gone there already ju cently intelligence was received of lurge agricultural operations earned oam me great salt lake region by slave labor and the w ashington correspondent of the baltimore suo writing under date of nov saya another sum will probablv be founded on tbe pacific by the mormons aud it is said that they ere slam holders to seme extent toed do not intend to exclude slavery so there will be another bone for the freetoilers to pkar and yet the entire whig pres will cry peace peace no pretest car agitation kc fcc and when tha iniquity u consummated and by methm of a clayton compromise a large proportion of our acquisitions are expeeed

of the north star is nearly completedthat the closing days of another year of varied life are hovering around us and that the light of a new year is soon to dawn it seems a proper i tide in our own affairs to offer a few words upon our paper and its prospects during the present year we have purposely refrained from afflicting our readers with narrations of our own personal toils cares anxieties and difficulties we hate anything like whining and shall indulge in none of it now if we did not assume our piesent position intelligent iy we did assume it voluntarily and have therefore met its responsibilities and duties j most cheerfully and shall continue to do sow hile we continue to occupy it of regrets losses disappointments dangers and discouragements we shall say nothing here they i are the common lot of most men who undertake any great w ork for the welfaie of mankind and we are not singular in having alarge share of such dispensations besides this consideration we have the consolation that the grace ol god has ever been sufficient lor us and for all sorrows troubles and hardships we have been doubly repaid in the satisfaction which ever accompanies a faithful discharge of duty our joys have far exceeded our sorrows and our experience has imparted to us much that will be valuable to us through life all this we deem a full compensation for our past labors and trials in ef foits to keep our sable witness in the field we shall therefoie make no complaints but dispense at once with the past and look to the evei bright and evei hopeful future the first quemion which the friends of the paper will ask and to which they wish a definite and decided answer relates to the continuance of the north star do you mean to continue the paper to this we answer in all sincerity yes we do most certainly mean to continue it that much has been fully and we hope advisedly resolved upon we have put away all doubt timidity and hesitation the north star must and will remain a fixed star in the antislavery sky as in the brave old overhanging firmament it was not at the suggestion of a fitful impulse or an effervescent aspiration that we commenced the publication of this paper we considered the demand for such a paper counted the cost surveyed the gtoundand engaged in the enterprise with a full purpose of heart our course is onward and we shaii neither turn back nor turn aside and if our earnest endeavors shall not be crowned with success the responsibility and reproach shall fall elsewhere than upon us with aswarm a heart and with as much zeal as that with which we have commenced and with which we have until now persevered we shall continue happily for us thus far we have fulfilled our hugest promises to the very letter and this is the best assurance we can now give to our readeis of what they may expect for the future the north star ought must and as far as our fiat can go shall be sustained let all doubts be removed and let readers and friends unite to help those who are at least deserting itin that they display a willingness to help themselves remember that the most successful mode to defeat a praiseworthy undertaking is to fold our arms and doubt seriously doubt if the undertaking will succeed the stern necessity which called the north star into being exists now with all its former force palpableness and intensity the radical evils it was designed in some measure to eradicatethe malicious assaults it was designed to ward offthe gross and dangerous errors it was designed to correct and dispelthe strong overwhelming and almost resistless

compelled us to gain a livelihood by the very least lucrative menial and in the eyes of the community degrading employments this is no fancy sketch hut a simple picture of stem and bitter every day realities they have long existed and do now existand while they continue to exist they will continue to demand trumpet tongued all true hearts right minds and industrious hands for their complete overthrow and abolishment we therefore say again and with additional emphasis that the necessity which called the north star into existence now imperiously demands its continuance but to these general reasons there are other and especial ones which may be properly added to the startling catalogue already adduced we are especially singled out from all other people under the whole heavens as the objects degradation we are the injured it is meet that we should especially contend lor redress we are the victimsit becomes us to appeal to say that we suffer grievous wrongs is more touching than to say that they suffer wrongs but above all itis needful that the colored people should have a living constant palpable and unmistakeable example to present in confutation of the slander which insists upon the natural inferi ority of our race with which we are so perpetually and so injuriously assailed and what may we ask is a better example than the regular publication of large weekly periodical conducted by a fugitive slave who has never had the advantage of a single days schooling and has spent the best educational period of his life under the dark and depraving yoke of american slavery it is said that we might be betted employed as a lectui er than as an editor we answer that none need complain on that score since we do both and have probably delivered as many lectures traveled as many milesattended as many meetingsand labored as haid during the past two years as any antislavery lecturer now in the field what we have done we mean still to do while life and health and slavery endure it may be said that we say this boastfully be it sohut who can say that we say it untruthfully no man well let no man who lias an antislavery heait in his bosom refuse to aid the north star on the unfounded pretence that its publication would prevent our more useful and more suitable occupation of the lecturing field many of our warm friends have entertained this notion but they must now see that ihejiolion is unfounded we admit the desirableness of having efficient colored antislavery lecturers in the field and that a part of these should be fugitive slaves and of the latter those who have more recently escaped are to our mind decidedly to be preferred they tell their story with a freshness and simplicity which commends its truth to the hearts of those who hear while the older and more experienced speakers who confine themselves to their narratives be thejf never so touching or harrowing their effect upon the heareis is soon lost in the frequency of their reiteration we should have long since failed to make ourselves useful in the antislavery field had we confined ourselves to our simple story but even if this were not the case this department of labor is nowbetter provided for than at any former time the clarks browns bibbs watsons and crafts have all been occupying the field of late their narrations are doing a glorious work and we thank heaven that such witnesses against slavery have been so rapidly brought forward there will be more of the same make and mould raising their manly brows above the surface of ignorance oppression and slavery these men are an evidence that ethiopia is indeed reaching forth her hand unto god her sons are rising from degradation to re spectabilityare seeking to do something noble worthy of manhood to our old subscribers we would say there is not one among you all that we can afford to spare you are all needed upon our list and yet mote we need your aid in extending the circulation of the paper you have kindly borne with the early imperfections and shortcomings of the editorial department ol the northstar dont quit us until we give signs of having ceased to improve the business of editing a large weekly journal like ours may be easy enough to men of education aud reading but it will certainly not be considered a light task for ooe who has to educate himself and instruct others at the same time but wg promised to make no poor faces si the commence meat of this article and we shall now shun the very appearance ol such an evil we close this article by expressing our neartfelt gratitude to our kind transatlantic friends who continue to notice and appreciate our humble labors and who have never deserted uv in the hour of need they kindly supplied us the means with which to commence our present work and have faithfully stood by us through good sod through evil report since that commencement we would also mention gratefully the generous saemt ance rendered us ounag the autumn by the western new york amislavery society and the noble efforts of the womens aseoct stion of philadelphia we hope these deer friends and cuworkers wdj never have cause to regret their generous cooperation with us aud if a

qjjmisi wlk pwpo m  necessary and unavoidable engagements brood most be mu only apology for not sooner replying to mr whippet iae letter the national league published in the north star nojp anything from that source touching the interests and prospects of the oppressed and proscribed people to whom we belong is entitled to very high re spec he is a geotletnan of acknowledged ability a profound thinker an aioqaent and forcible writer and withal an earnest friend of liberty from such a man we always differ reluctantly hi letter before ns display all the qualities of bead and heart which we hare with pride and pleasure ascribed to him and while we differ widely from him in his rea onings and conclusions upon the subject in question we are aiocerely glad that so able a pen as his should be wielded by a sable band and that he has felt called upon to record pub licly hi opinions with respect to the projected league perhaps it will not be assuming i too much to account for the difference between us and our esteemed friend on the ground that we are more practical and less theoretical than h with abstractions and theories he is at home and in these he can easily find objections to measures which we daam of immediate and practical importance he sees a seeming ceitainly not real incon aistency between the end and the means by which that end is proposed to be attained with him the necessary but rude scaffolding must not be arranged lest its awkward appearance should obscure the magnificent edifice proposed to be erected as an illustration of the truth of what we hare just remarked we take the following r from his letter the expsdiency of an organized union i among our people has long engaged my ati tention and i cfo most freely confess that it appears to me to be a subject that is fraught with difficulties and dangers as well as prom ises and blessings haring confessed the difficulties and dangers to be apprehended from the formation of the proposed league mi w gives his reasons for those apprehensions as follows i believe that the motto union of the oppressed for the sake of freedom will be interpreted by tie proslavery press to mean an union of the black against the while man and the overthrow of american institutions for however atangeand unnatuial it may appear it is nevertheless true that the success of any movement among ourselves is tnote dependent on the praise of our enemies than the labors of our friends for of late our denunciations have been as uneiringly directed against abolitionists as slaveholders when you shall have launched the league in the proslaveiy current of this nation you will be obliged to answer the nautical questions viz from whence do you hail what ts your object and to what port you ate destined or receive a broadside you well know that we have no security in the divine nature of our object for that being interpreted in llte popular tongue means devil incarnate and vestal purity of motive a rapacious desire to corrupt all that is good and holy in the affections of the riiul titsde so deeply seated are the leligious and political prejudices against which we have ts contend that virtue and vice change tlieii character to auit the complexion of tlie actor during the recent eventful period of nations the press lias been teeming with the lute ei leagues for civil and religious reform and the proclamation has gone forth that god is on the side of the strong it will be useless to say that this is not a complexional question for its success would depend on so stating it and the collision springing from its action against public sentiment would be more likely to increase and concentrate existing prejudices than scatter and disseminate them it is therefore no less a dictate of interest than humanity to avoid a complexional issue here then are the reasons alleged against the leagne plainly and strongly slated let us examine them the first point made is that such a league will be interpreted by the proslavery press to mean an union ol the black against the white man and the overthrow of american institutions it may be said in reply that the objection is an old one and is as true as it is old foi never since the day that moses called upon the egyptian monarch to let the israelites go free until the day that william lloyd garrison startled this guilty land by a similar demand has there been a movement against slavery and oppression but w hich has had in its course to submit to the embarrassment ol mijinterpretation misrepresent at ion and even slander it is the common baptism ol all great movements it is the forty day fasting in the wilderness to try the faith and to test the integrity of their projectors lei him who cannot stand mirinterpretation never attempt to stem the popular current foi such an one will only attempt to fail bui after all we think the apprehension of out esteemed correspondent are much greater thar the occasion will justify if the public mint were as dark now on the subject of human rights as it was twenty years ago and such a movement had been proposed the ground urged would wear a more rational aspect but now when colored men cau speak wnte and publish their views to the world with th utmost impunity in tbo northern slate ii seems almost worse than timidity for u tf hesitate in the adoption of measures for oui improvement and elevation from the fear ol muinterpretation there is now in this com trj a willingness nay a waiting to hai what we have to say we are therefore folly able to set ourselves righl before the community in the first place we should attempt nothing but what would be right ju t and secondly we should of course have the sympathy of the wise and good of every c loi  out righteous endeavors bet says ui friend any movement among ourselves it more dependent on the grout of our enem a than the labors of our friends a stuguhu notion truly are our movements then to b shaped to the pleasure of our enemies an we then to conform to their wishes to secure then praises shall we adopt such measures ad soeb measures only as shall secure te ppmhauon of oar oppressors nowo do aot believe that friend wkipper would bus pursue any such unmanly cringing sod contemptible policy and yet such might emu jfc inferred from the idea thrown out by huff wo do no know what he means shen ho mye of late our denunciations have beu unerringly directed against abohuomju ts slaveholders if n be we are out aware of it and the offenders ought to he ex the nautical qonstions which the lw will

upon the sword oor weapons ate not the dilfcr enee is groat bat the grand argument against the formation of the langne is that it will present a ctmptjiomal ism this is a danger to be avoided but is it true of this movement do coloted men by associating themselves together for the purpose of obtaining equal rights with all other citirons thereby mako a crifnplexiooal issue with their white fetlowjeooniryiaee so it don not seem us it strikes us that the issue is tendered from the other side the ground baa already been taken that colored men shall not possess equal etvil social and political advantages with white men leaving us no other alternative bnt to submit or to resist now shall we tamely quietly submit shall we remain io die house all day when others are at work and merely sally forth in the dark unseen lest we should seem make a complexional issue we sre not to say to treacherous pennsylvania restore th e black mans right of suffrage for fear of making complexions issues wt are not to ask admission for oor children into common schools to avoid complexional issues w eare not to go into the cabiu of steamboats among chut men dial we may void complexional issues but seuously the objection is too palpably absurd to require the aid of ridicule to expose it and yet it has its advocates in high quarters for our part we wish colored men could be induced to make any kind of an issue we want some sign of lifesome evidence of a common desire to improve ourqiresent condition and to take some position in the moral world at present we are for the most part dead we ate seen in the worlds activities only by proxy an occasional head is seen to rise above the surface but his legs soon give way for the want of sympathy and he fallperhaps to rise againperhaps not now an organization such as that suggested hy the league would at least put us in the way of doing something it would give us a position but says our correspondent the thing is impossiblethe oppressed have adopted the religious creeds of our oppressors e this is true but onlv true of a pat tof us there are some among us who repudiate at least most part of the religion of the land that assumes the natural inferiority of the colored uiau we must however stop here simply by saying that whatever may be the difficulties dangers and hardships attending it we are for the formation of a colored national leagueand hope to have the influence of our esteemed friend whippet to help forward that resultr o father mathew in a difficulty the state temperance cen vent ion assembled at marietta in georgia last summer tendered through judge lumpkin of that state a cordial invitation to father mathew to visit georgia in furtherance of the temperance cause but the judge having subsequently learned that the name of father mathew had been attached in company with that of daniel oconnell to a wellknown antislavery remonstrance w rote to the reerend father inquiring whether he hadtieeu correctly informed and it so whether lie still entertained the same sentiments on the subject of slavery after waiting one month the writer received a very brief reply marked private and which lias not been published in the meantime says the judge the several temperance associations in the state had pas aed resolutions revoking the invitation sofar as they had been parties to it the judge then wrote once more to father mathew complaining that his reply explained nothing and intimating that in these circumstances his visit to the south could be productive of only evil to the temperance cause no reply has been received to this communication and here is the summing up of the whole matter by the judge under these circumstanceswith a clear comprehension i trust of the responsibility thus incurred and with the most profound regret as to the miscarriage of our hopes herewith so long as have the power at least and with the hearty concurrence and approval of the executive committee of the convention withdraw the invitation so cordially and sincerely offered viewing our cause as we do as the chief hope of man we must not permit it to be wounded in the house of its friends we will welcome no one knowingly among us who fraternizes himself or encourages otheis to do so with a faction which would recklessly shiver the union into fiagmeuis which would reck its unhallowed hands red as crimson in human bloodwhich in a word seems combine m one mass all the woist elements of thought action and feeling peculiar to our troublous times thus it is likely that father mathew io trying to meet the views of the north without offending the south will find himself deserted by both this is exactly the treatment be deserves for seeking to he neutral in tbe cause of human freedom may he profir by  ihe experience to ibe antislavery friends of wester new york and elsewhere we nee with regret in the anti slavery standard of the lh mat that tire th of january is

members may endeavor to console themselves with the difficulties of as a precedent but the cases are not parallel at that time the delay was occasioned not by the speakers election but by the disputed seats of the new jersey election as the case now stands the obstinacy of one or two individuals may prevent forever an organization and it is therefore due to the legislation of the country that the whigs and democrats the two great parties should unite on some plan to put down that disorganizing spirit which has manifested itself on tuesday there were six more ballot ings for speaker without effecting a choice the last stood winthrop brown of ind wilmott morehead durkee bingham and me dowall each mr winthrop withdrew his name and in so doing delivered an address as follows it is well known to my friends that i have not sought the place to which their pat tialityhas long been striving to elevate me and it is known too to a considerable majority of them that would have withdiawn at the start if they would have concentrated their votes on any other but in this matter my own wishes if not my own judgment were overruled by gentlemen in whom i have the highest confidence and i therefore yielded all along to their opinions have all along expressed my own desire that the house should be organized and have believed that further delay would be detrimental to some of the best interests of the country i need not add then with how much reluctance saw myself the instrument of that delay my friends however would not suffer my name to be under my own control and it was not until today that i could obtain their consent to retire from the position in which i have been placed beg leave therefore now to say and to say publicly before the house what i have before often said in private that can consent no longer to be in the way of some kind of organization and that i now withdraw the use of my name ji desire publicly to thank those who have all along been voting for me and to express iny very warmest hopes that they will be bet  tei able to concentrate their votes on some other on the delivery of this address great excitement and confusion prevailed and an adjournment was moved and earned doings at washingtonsouthern whigs seceding the correspondent of the new york express gives an account of a meeting of the whig members of congress held to arrange a course of action which came to a rather interesting termination showing symptoms of division and disoigautzation inthe whig camp which will help to bring northern men of that party to declare themselve more decidedly than they have yet done in favor of freedom or as is quite as likely quicken their movements in perpetuating and strengthening their ignominious subserviency to the slave power it is in substance this mr toombe of georgia immediately af i ter the organization of the meeting offered a j resolution to the effect that congress ought not to pass any law prohibiting slavery in the territories of california or new mexico nor any law abolishing slavery in llte district of columbia the reading of this resolution of course produced great excitement the mol ton was seconded

that mav be interesting to your readers we have had quite a stirring lime of it in these dtggins for the last two weeks first the ease of frances smith the tacts in the case are theae the smith family were claimed as the propeity of the late judge gaston of newbern north carolina the younger smiths are quadroons i pon the jeath of judge gaston his heirs alter considerable consultation permuted wm smith togo to work with the view of purchasing himself for which purpose he repaired to the city of washington and by his own industry has succeeded in paying for lus own freedom at the time of the sale of the property of judge gastons heirs william prevailed upon one amos wade merchant of newbern to purchase his mother and sister in order to save them from being sold to the far south he has since redeemed his mother at the price of fifty dollars which together with paid for himself makes five hundred and sev entythree dollars he has raised by his own industry he now appeals to the liberality and humanity of the people of the north to assist him in rescuing a young and beautiful sister tromthe new orleans market and save her from what may yet be it she is not rescued a condition worse than death amos wade writes that she is a good girl and i believe a virtuous girl she is a member of church and is respected by the members of her church as a christian i have been offered one thousand dollars for het by traders but if your object is to free her will reduce the price toa christian girla virtuous girl years old and handsome and one thousand dollars offered for her by traders what means this oh ye christians and republican of the north blush to think meetings to sympathize with and assist mr smith have been held in brooklyn and new york but lam ashamed to say they were very thinly attended had these meetings been exhibitions of a monkey with a red jacket on the churches which were reluctantly granted for them to beheld in would have been filled to replet in but when

recognize the right ot the slaveholder to property in his fellowbe ings any more than the traveller recognize the right ol the robber to his purse when he surrenders it rather than his life bdly that while laboring to overthrow the whole system ot slavery we must not harden our hearts and resist individual appeals as we would not be feeling for those in bonds as though bound with them dly that

and uttered various exclamations about hi family arid children and also saying the villian i am ruined or the villian he has ruined me all who wete present agree that he did not sav he was betrayed one of the officers think from some broken sentences that he caught that the prisoner said something about some one having placed the limbs where they were found for the purpose of obtaining the reward and that the discovery of them there would involve the prisoners rain when asked if he was willing to go to the college and view the remains he consented and was carried rather than led to the car nage after he returned to jail ihe prisoner became somewhat more calm he stated that no one had access to his apartments in the college but himself and could not have such access but with his keys he not only had the keys of these apartments in his possession but also the key a large one of the watercloset under whieh the lemains were found this closet was within the laboratory and not accessible from without that apartment and tbe door was locked w hen the limbs were found below saturday morning brought with it still further discoveries officer rice in arranging things in the

in the bottom bedded in hemlock bark the left thigh and the halfroasted trunk of the body the skin had been wholly burnt or tripped off from the trunk the thigh was only stained with the bark all the parts found are such in size that they may very well have belonged to dr ps body the missing portions and supposed to have been burnt up are the head contents of the body left leg and foot arms and hands and right foot among the secondary facts it may be stated that four bloody towels were found in the vaut a very laige clasp knife with hunting figures on the blade was found with the trunk in

upon the investigation of sunday and found fragments of calcined bones fiom each of the missing parts ol the body r lhere was something like the appearance of a wide stab on the left side of the trunk

was occupied a distinguished position id the scientific world as professor of chemistry and mineralogy in harvatd university of which the medical college in boston is a branch dr parkman was once an

gray at co some of dr parkmans friends assuming that dr webster killed dr p suppose that au angry altercation occurred at the interview on friday and that dr parkmam who occasionally used very blunt language said something which so exasperated dr webster that the latter suddenly dealt him a mortal blow with some implement at hand and then to conceal the rash and fata deed resorted to ihe means

most faithfully to be adhered to remembering it is by united efforts that the bonds of the fettered slave must be broken we know that the laborers in the great work of reform are comparatively few but truth is mighty and we are encouraged in believing that the day of redemption draweth nigh as tie are assured that the faithfulness of the few tried and devoted friends of freedom has already sundered the chains and set at liberty many a desponding asplive and the reflection stimulates us to a greater devotedness knowing full well that the corrupting and demoralizing effects of slavery on our white as well as our colored brothers and sisters call loudly and imperatively upon our holiest feelings for energetic action while opportunity is yet afforded considering the disabilities we are laboring under and the apathy of the mass around us on this vitally interesting subject much has been done in these parts during the past year but a steady petsevering uncompromising devotion is indispensable and we hope that while we labor with untiring zeal to strike at the root of this infernal system we shall remember that bursting the fetters should be followed by the genial influences of sympathy and elevation and that during our deliberations some suggestions may be made with regard to devising means to place the escaped bondmen in situations in which their long buried intellect their manhood shall he called out that they may be prepared to receive the truth that they may be recipients of gods love and thus be enabled to enjoy the boon of liberty of which they have so long been robbed we

maasachoaetts and coined all tba money that m made there he wae ia a new line of business for in the early days of the colony the current coinage of the people consisted of the gold nod silver money of england portugal and spain these coins be mg scarce the people were often forced to barter their commodities instead of selling them for instance if a man wanted to baya coat be perhaps exchanged a beafa skin for it if he wished tor a harm of molasses be might purchase it witha pile of pine boards musket bullets were used instead of farthings the indians had a sort of money caled wampum which was made of clamshells and this strange sort of specie was likewise taken in payment of debts by the english settlers bank bills had never been heard of there was not enough of any kind in many parts of the country to pay their ministers so they thad to take quintals of fish bushels of corn or cords of wood instead of silver or gold as the people grew more numerous and their trade with one another increased the want of money was stillmore sensibly felt to supply the demand the general court passed a law for establishing a coinage of shillings sixpences and threepences capt john hull was appointed to manufacture the money and was to have about one shilling out of every twenty to pay him for his trouble of making them hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to capt john hull the battered silver cans and tankards suppose and silver buckles and broken spoons and silver hilts of swords that had figured at courtall such curious articles were thrown into the pot together but bv far the greatest part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines of south america which the english buccaneers who were little better than pirates had taken from the spaniards and brought to massachusetts all this old and new silver being melted down and coined the result was an immense amount of splendid shillings sixpences and threepences each had the date of on one side and the figure of a pine tree on the other side hence they were called pinetree shillings and for every twenty shillings that he coined you will remember capt hull was entitled to put one shilling in his pocket the magistrates soon began to suspect that the mintmaster would have the best of the bargain they offered him a large sum of money if he would give up that twentieth shilling which he was continually dropping into his own pocket capt hull declared that he was perfectly satisfied with the shilling and well he might be for so diligently did he labor that in a few years his pockets his moneybags and his strong box were overflowing with pinetree shillings this was probably the case when he came in possession of a grandfathers chair to rest himself in when the mintmaster had grown very rich a young man samuel sewel by name came acourting his only daughter whose name i do not know but we will call her betsey who was a fine hearty damsel by no means so slender as some young ladies of our own days on the contrary having always fed heartily on pumpkin pies doughnuts indian puddings and other puritan dainties she was round and plump asa pudding with this round rosy miss betsey did samuel sewel fall in love as he was of a good character industrious in business and a member of the church the mintmaster very readily gave his consent ves you may take her said hein his rough way and you will find her a heavy burden enough on the wedding day as we may suppose that honest hull dressed himself in a plain colored coat all the buttons of which were made of pinetree shil j lings the buttons of his waistcoat sixpences and the knees of his small i clothes were buttoned wiih threepen j ces thus attired he sat with great dignity in his grandfathers chair and being a portly old gentleman he completely filled it from elbow to elbow on tbs opposite side of the room bel tween the bridesmaids sat miss bet j sey she was blushing with all her might and looked like a fullblown peony a great red apple or any other round and scarlet object there too was the bridegroom dressed in a fine purple coat and gold lace waistcoat with as much other finery as the puritan laws and customs would allow him to put on his hair was cropped close to his head because gov endicott bad forbidden any one to wear it below the ears but he was a very respectable young man and so thought the bridesmaids and miss betsey herself the mintmaster was pleased with his new soninlawespecially as he had said nothing at all about her portion so when the marriage ceremony was over capt hull whispered a w ord or two to his menservants who immediately went out and soon returned lugging a pair of scales ttiey were such a pair as wholesale merchants use for weighing a bulky commoditv was now to be weighed in them daughter betsey said the mint msster go into one side of the scales miss betsey or mrs swel ns we must now call her did as she was bid like a dutiful child without any question or why or wherefore but what her father could mean aniens to moke her husband pay for bor by the pound n y ch would have boon a dear bargain she had not the least idea and now euid honest john hull x

tbs scales while betsey remained in the other jingle jingle went the shillings as handful after handful was thrown intill plump and ponderous as sba was they fairly weighed the young lady from the floor there son sewel cried the honest mintmaster resuming bin neat in grandfathers chair take these shillings for my daughtersa portion use her kindly and thank heaven for ter it is not every wife that is worth ter weight in silver the children laughed heartily at this legend and would hardly be convinced but that grandfather had made it out of his own head he assured them faithfully however that be ted found it in the pages of a great historian and had merely tried however to tell it in a somewhat funuier manner well grandfather remarked clara if wedding portions nowadays were paid as
